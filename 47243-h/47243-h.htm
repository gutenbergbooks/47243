<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-xi.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> I look at the completed MSS.
of the first volumes of the <i>Sportswoman's
Library</i>, I feel deeply grateful
to the many good sportswomen
who have aided me in my work, not only for the
great stores of practical knowledge they have
brought to bear on the several subjects of which
we have treated, but for the way in which they
have collaborated with me. For this my warmest
thanks are due to them one and all.</p>

<p>The object we have placed before us, is to give
women the information and help they are not
likely to find in those books, which are written
chiefly from a man's point of view, and we have
therefore avoided, as far as possible, trenching
on ground that has been already adequately
covered by those who, to sportsmen and sportswomen
alike, are the best authorities on the various
subjects. If, therefore, our writings sometimes
seem to be wanting in completeness, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
is, I venture to think, to be attributed to this
cause.</p>

<p>When I first gathered round me the body of
contributors, some of whom were personally unknown
to me, I could but feel that the many
threads I held in my hand might prove to be a
very "tangled skein," before the work was
brought to completion. This foreboding, however,
I am glad to say, was entirely without
foundation, for each writer threw herself into
her part with such genuine determination to do
the best she could for the <i>matter</i> of her work,
that the minor details as to the <i>manner</i> in which
it should be given to the world, did not assume
undue proportions, and there has been nothing
to throw the slightest shadow over the harmony
in which we have worked. That the effort we
have thus jointly made to give some help to our
sister-sportswomen may be successful, is to wish
the writers the best reward they can have, for
the labour they have bestowed.</p>

<p>Besides my fellow workers, I have a debt of
gratitude to discharge to all who have so kindly
assisted me. Foremost among these I must
acknowledge the valuable help given by Lady
Gifford, Mrs. Pryse-Rice, Mrs. Cheape, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Miss Lloyd, of Bronwydd, without whose assistance
I could not have ventured to write on the
subject of Hare-Hunting: by Mr. T. F. Dale,
author of <i>The Game of Polo</i>, whose great practical
knowledge of sport has made him an invaluable
referee on many important questions: by
another good sportsman, Captain the Hon. R. C.
Drummond, who generously gave me the benefit
of his advice on matters which have been a lifelong
study to him: by Elizabeth, Lady Wilton;
Lady Theodora Guest, Lady Gerard, Lady
Dorothy Coventry, Mrs. Wrangham, Mrs. T. E.
Harrison, Miss Serrell, Mr. C. H. Bassett, late
Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds;
Mr. Ian Heathcoat-Amory, Master of the Tiverton
Staghounds; Mr. W. L. Wyllie, A.R.A.;
Miss Maud Earl, Miss Walrond, Mr. Cuthbert
Bradley, Dr. Lewis Mackenzie, Miss Florence
Ritson, and Mrs. Dudley Smith.</p>

<p>I must also acknowledge the help so readily
given by Mr. Charles Lancaster, and Messrs.
Holland and Holland, on the sport with which
their names are so closely connected, and I must
thank those photographers who have exercised
their skill on our behalf, viz.: Messrs. Lombardi
and Co., who, from the first, have helped us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
largely; Messrs. Lambert Weston, J. Weston
and Son, Stuart, Becken, and A. Debenham.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to the Proprietors of
<i>Baily's Magazine</i>, <i>The Field</i>, <i>The Gentlewoman</i>,
and <i>The Lady's Pictorial</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I must discharge the debt of gratitude
I owe Messrs. A. Constable and Co., for the unfailing
courtesy I have met with at their hands,
and for the hearty way in which they have
thrown themselves into the interests of the book.</p>

<p>Whether we have all succeeded in our object,
viz., to give clear, practical directions to women
in the several outdoor recreations of which we
have written, it is for our readers to determine,
and on their verdict will depend the extension of
our plan to other branches of sports and pastimes.</p>

<p>To the great body of sportsmen, who so far
have held almost undisputed sway in the realm
of sporting literature, I would plead:</p>

<h2><a name="CRUISING" id="CRUISING">CRUISING
AND SMALL YACHT RACING
ON THE SOLENT.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-017.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">How</span> can I with my poor pen do
justice to all the delights of yachting
as practised on the Solent? We need
a nautical Whyte Melville to describe
the joys of yacht-racing, and the real good sport
which is its chief characteristic.</p>

<p>What an exciting game it is, how enthralling,
how interesting, and more important still, how
wholesome. What a benefit for city men to get
right away to the sea, and enjoy such a complete
change and relaxation as this racing affords. And
how much they do appreciate it is shown by the
number of little boats owned by stockbrokers
and others who can only get down occasionally,
but, nevertheless, keep their boats out the whole
season through, so as not to lose the chance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
sail when their opportunity comes. Not on the
principle that race-horses are kept, either, as
every one knows there is no chance of a racing
boat doing more than pay her own way at best,
for the prizes are barely adequate to meet the
expenses.</p>

<p>Yacht-racing makes quite a new interest in
life. The clever mathematician can find a large
field for his energies in the designing line, and
the keen sailor a never-wearying delight in developing
to the utmost the powers of the boat
confided to him.</p>

<p>How much better than the London drawing-room's
close atmosphere is the fresh sea air, and
the delightful freedom of bounding over the
waves in a well-equipped craft, with the additional
pinch of excitement afforded by racing.
Let me assure you no fear of sea-sickness need
deter any. Many of us would not be proof
against a long Channel swell in a large steamer,
but the motion of our little boats over the diminished
waves inside the Wight, is not likely to
upset any but the most pronounced bad sailor.</p>

<p>Besides, the excitement of racing drives away
all qualms of that sort, sea-sickness being, I
believe, in most cases the result of boredom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
nervous anticipation as much as anything else.
No one could hate "yachting" as generally
accepted more than I do. Anything so boring as a
long sea voyage in a great lumbering schooner, I
cannot imagine. The fact of "being taken," in
nine cases out of ten, "where one would not,"
without having a hand in the matter, with a
large crew of slow men to do all the work and
take all the fun off one's hands, is to me nothing
but an aggravation. The deliberate "cut and
dried" way in which everything is done, the
foresail being lowered and the peak eased when
about two miles from the moorings, and such
cautious measures, fidget me to death. There is
this about racing, that one can never enjoy cruising
in the same way after one has experienced its
far superior joys. I must say, however, it is
rather nice after the scrimmage of a long day's
racing, to get on board a solid old cruiser and
bundle peacefully home. But woe betide you if
the wind is ahead, for you won't get home that
night. No, you must be of a very leisurely disposition,
and a great lover of Nature, for you to
appreciate stereotyped cruising. This kind of
thing is about as different from our Solent yachting,
as the Derby is from a Margate donkey ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course I can understand the pleasure of
cruising if the owner is also master of his vessel,
but such a state of things is the exception, the
owners mostly passing their time in standing
about deck, or having large meals below, utterly
oblivious of their course, their compass, or anything
else. This must be a very stagnant amusement
at the best, impossible to an energetic
disposition, and only suited to an invalid, or man
in his declining years. To people who lack any
sporting instincts, racing, I suppose, seems ridiculous,
but if they love the sea let them learn all
about it, and navigate their own vessels like men,
instead of being mere passengers on board their
own craft, while their skipper is getting all the
fun. Some women have taken their own line in
this matter, and having mastered the science of
navigation, are most enthusiastic on the subject,
realising how it enhances a hundred-fold the
pleasures of a sea voyage.</p>

<p>The news of a large schooner being on the
stocks now-a-days comes as a surprise, as this type
of vessel has almost entirely gone out of fashion
in this country. That is to say, though there are
still several to be seen about, the old ones being
used because they are too good to throw away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
so to speak, no new ones have been built for
years. The advantages of steam are so great for
cruising and travel, that they outweigh the more
pleasant sensation of sailing, which is the schooner's
only claim to superiority. The difference in the
expense is not very great after all, as you require
double the crew in a sailing craft, and at least
double the time to accomplish your distance. So
if you want to get&mdash;say to Gibraltar&mdash;the chances
are, that the extra time for which you are paying
your crew, would easily cover your coal bill
on the steamer. The auxiliary in nine cases out
of ten proves a simple farce. Many, I know,
have never once set their sails. It requires all
the crew of an "out-and-out" sailing boat, and
also the great unwieldly spars, which make it a
bad sea boat when not under canvas. I would
only recommend an auxiliary to a real wanderer,
a born "man of the sea" like Lord Brassey, for
whom of course there is nothing like it. The
variety afforded in sailing and steaming on a
lengthened sea trip, must be attractive and resting,
and when both courses are open, you would
not need to carry so much coal as in a steamer, or
endure the wearisome hours becalmed in a heavy
swell, which are such a drawback to sailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The discomfort people will endure in the name
of yachting, has always been a marvel to me.
The less they know about the life on board, the
more you will find they patiently put up with.
They seem to think because they are on a yacht,
cleanliness, <i>cuisine</i>, even elbow-room itself, should
be entirely abjured. The miseries that rational,
civilised human beings will suffer in this respect,
is a constant source of wonder, to those who
know how unnecessary they are. Not that these
sufferers do not like yachting, for they are even
persuaded to put their foot on board a yacht a
second time after such experiences. It is only
novices in the game, however, that you will find
suffering these deprivations, for, believe me, there
is no need for them. Do not overcrowd your
vessel, or cut her accommodation up into about
a dozen little cabins, into which you would not
put a dog on land. You really require double
the room for living afloat that you do ashore, as
even your exercise has to be taken on board.
There is nothing to prevent your having most
home comforts, a boiling hot sea-water bath every
morning, for example, and your meals served as
well as they are in your own house. Neither
need you have a bed only two feet wide, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>it is impossible to turn over without parting
with the bedclothes. It is no longer necessary
to go about on all fours, even in a 20-tonner, any
size below which I would not recommend for a
night's lodging.</p>

</div>

<p>It is the custom of builders to furnish a small
saloon with gigantic sideboards, or lockers, as
they are called. These are ugly, clumsy, superfluous
impediments, which are only made into
receptacles for every sort of rubbish, and take up
an immense amount of room. There is no need
to have your store cupboard in the drawing-room,
as by a little ingenuity ample room can be devised
in the pantry, and in a safe on deck. Another
plan is to have a passage down the side from
forward right away aft, which obviates the perpetual
disturbance of the stewards passing through
your sitting-room. There is then only one door,
which necessarily makes a much cosier room.
Unless you are an assured good sailor, do not be
beguiled into occupying the "after cabin," which
is likewise called the "ladies' cabin." How it
earned this appellation I am at a loss to explain,
as I was always brought up to suppose ladies
came first, and if they are relegated to the after
cabin they very decidedly come off second-best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
There is twice the motion aft that there is in the
middle of the vessel, and in a steamer you feel
twice the vibration, beside being right over the
screw.</p>

<p>How one gets spoilt! I remember sailing
about as proud as Punch in an old Itchen ferry
boat, with ragged sails and tarred topsides. The
distances we used to cover, and the weather we
went through in this old <i>Zephyr</i> are a wonder to
look back upon. The whole day, from nine in
the morning till nine at night, used to be spent
on board, and the experience never palled, as far
as I remember. Large lunches were always provided,
in case of our getting becalmed, or stuck
on the mud, both very frequent occurrences. We
were always out to tea, and to boil the kettle in
a choppy sea was the great excitement. There
was only a kind of dog-hole place forward, where
this important function took place. It was a
severe test for the best "sailor" to balance a hot
lamp, head over ears in methylated spirits, the
hot fumes of which inundated the small cabin,
while she patiently waited till the water boiled.</p>

<p>It was even worse at night, when a smelly
paraffin lamp which would have made the atmosphere
almost unbearable ashore, had to be endured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and in a small and lively boat was certainly trying.
When we were "caught out" on our way
home from some long expedition, the unfortunate
women of the party used to be thrust into this
salubrious resort, ostensibly for their own comfort,
really and truly, to get them out of the way.
That <i>was</i> a place, when there were half a dozen
women in there, a paraffin lamp, and the door
shut! If one of us ventured so much as to open
a chink of door, it was instantly shut again, with
such exclamations from our male tyrants as&mdash;"Whatever
you want to come out for, into all
this wet and cold, when you can be warm and
cosy in there, I can't think," upon which the
brow-beaten female crawled back disconsolate
into her lair, muttering rebelliously. And yet
we were nothing daunted. Out we would be
again with the dawn, to go through all the same
thing without a dissenting thought.</p>

<p>We had not even the luxury of a paid hand
in those days, my brother, and my sisters and
myself doing all the work, which was a splendid
education in more ways than one. I reluctantly
confess I am spoilt for this sort of thing now,
though I shall always look back upon the time
with pleasure, and I very much doubt if it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not one of the most enjoyable experiences in my
life. It was all so new, so different from inland
amusements, and I then learnt that a sea life has
a charm all its own.</p>

<p>In 1888 we hired a 40-ton old-fashioned yawl
called the <i>Fox</i>, with which we went in for the
regular stereotyped cruising, as generally accepted.
It was not a success, and I cannot say I enjoyed
it. My back was always aching from stooping,
and there was a permanent bruise on my head from
constant impact with the beams. Besides, we
were always being thwarted in our most urgent
desires by the weather&mdash;as the skipper said&mdash;<i>really</i>
by the incompetence of the vessel to cope with the
elements. It was never worth while for instance
starting with a head wind, as the time the yawl
would take in accomplishing any distance, would
have worn even Job's patience to a shadow.</p>

<p>Of course we share the sailor's love of fishing,
and two large trawlers have been built at Brixham,
by my brother and brother-in-law, for the
special purpose. The <i>Goddess</i> was a huge great
yawl, most comfortable below, and a grand sea
boat. We did plenty of trawling in her, miles
outside the Eddystone, and made some grand
hauls. She had an enormous great trawl-beam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and steam to get it with. Night was the best
time for fishing, and we were not spared if we
happened to be enjoying our beauty sleep, when
the momentous four hours were up. The row of
course would have awaked the dead, and so we
scrimmaged into our clothes and rushed on deck
ready to claw the great net on board. A waterproof
overall and indiarubber boots were essential
for this performance, and old gauntlet gloves
were a precaution against stinging fish, advisable
for the uninitiated. What a grand sight it was.
Picture a bright moonlight night, when you
were alone on the great rolling ocean, nothing in
sight except perhaps the fitful gleam of the Eddystone
in the far distance. The great vessel with
shortened sail, dipping and curtseying to the
proud billows which toyed with her bulky form,
as though it was nothing more than a feather.
Then amidst great shouting and racket, the huge
trawl-beam was brought slowly alongside, and
the heavy net was clawed on board full of treasures
from "the hallowed precincts of the deep."
What a flippering was there, from whiting, soles,
red mullet, etc., etc. What wonderful curiosities
do live in Davey Jones' locker. All kinds of
leggy, finny, and jelly mollusca, none of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
very appetising in appearance, and most of them
imbued with some formidable means of defence,
such as a sting or a prickle. Once we got two
enormous dog-fish, measuring five foot long, they
were a great nuisance, as they cut the net all to
pieces and were no good to man or beast.</p>

<p>One of the best hauls we ever made was in the
<i>Wayfarer</i>, my brother's trawler, between Torquay
and Dartmouth, when we had the whole deck
full of fish, mostly whiting and soles, and the
trouble was to get rid of them, even though we
supplied every one in Dartmouth, and that in
the time of the regatta.</p>

<p>Brixham and Bosham fishermen are much
pleasanter to deal with than the self-styled
"Yachtsmen," and they give much less trouble,
do more work and require less wage. The custom
of making a friend of the "Captain" is a
huge mistake, as these individuals are usually
the most wholesale extortioners that exist. The
exorbitant wages they demand for filling a luxurious
billet would stagger a longshoreman, and
the petty pilferings, nominally perquisites, in
which they indulge are what really make yachting
so expensive. The familiar manner of some
of these brass-bound autocrats is simply atrocious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
They seem to consider themselves complete masters
of the situation, and treat the owner and his
friends as so much superfluous cargo to be ordered
about at their desire. This, without any exaggeration,
is the state of things on numerous yachts
I could name, more especially those with lady-owners.</p>

<p>To turn now to clothes, that all important
point to members of my sex. I can only venture
to suggest the merest hints, as really it is not a
subject on which I am an authority, that is to
say, if one is supposed to practise what one
preaches. Brown in any form is to be avoided
on the water, it is unspeakably ugly, and a number
of people dressed in brown on a boat would
destroy its appearance, be it never so smart.
Nothing looks so well as white and red, or dark
blue, but not black. Blue gauze veils are useful,
but not ornamental, though a broad-brimmed
sailor hat embraces both these virtues.</p>

<p>I have been twice to the Mediterranean, once
in a sailing boat, the <i>Goddess</i>, and once in a steam
yacht, the <i>Normania</i>. So I will close my cruising
yarns with a description of what we experienced
at the hands of a Greek pilot. We were between
the Pir&aelig;us and Corfu one evening when it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
on suddenly very dark and dirty. Being a very
determined party of women on board, we made a
stand for taking shelter behind one of the islands.
We all "held a board" on the chart, but could
see no harbour of refuge equal to sheltering our
sumptuous craft. The little Greek pilot however
proved equal to the occasion. Pointing out a
small indentation in the coast, he urged us to
confide in him, and he would guarantee us a
peaceful night. Accordingly we slowed down
the engines, and made for a faint red light. The
chart, by the bye, said this light should be green,
but that was neither here nor there. There was a
rocky promontory sticking out with a lighthouse
on the end, where was the aforesaid red light
that should have been <i>green</i>. This our valiant
pilot steered straight for. It was blowing a
sirocco, with thick rain and a heavy sea, nevertheless
we all stood on the bridge to watch the
hazardous venture. On we went, straight for
the rocks where the rollers were breaking. It
was becoming decidedly interesting, and as the
chart evidently did not consider the place worth
its serious attention, we could no longer look to
that for guidance. Very soon the darkness and
hurly-burly of the storm lifted for a second, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
displayed a most disorganizing prospect. We
were almost on the beach on the starboard side,
and could have thrown a biscuit into the lighthouse
window on the port, and there was land
right ahead. We were in a little pocket, a neck
of rocks which ran parallel to the coast, taking
the fury of the waves, and affording a good
shelter. But a tighter place for a five hundred
ton vessel could not be imagined. When we
looked out of our ports in the morning, we were
still more astonished, for without exaggeration
we could have held easy converse with the
people ashore all round the vessel, while our bow
positively overshadowed the small quay. It was
a place into which one would have hesitated to
take a 50-tonner with twin screws in broad daylight,
and for a 500-tonner to get in safely in a
howling hurricane, and when it was pitch dark,
was indeed a feat of ingenuity.</p>

<p>Of course it entailed backing out, but as the
yacht fortunately was a very handy vessel, this
was safely accomplished. Such little incidents,
which lend a piquancy to cruising dispel the
monotony, and while they keep up the interest
in the manipulation of your vessel, also serve to
entertain your friends on getting home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Yacht-racing is in every respect a sport suited
to our sex. No unseemly gymnastics, no over-straining
or over-tiring, no cruelty can be laid to
its charge, in fact nothing to offend the most
exacting upholder of the feminine. Yet Yacht-racing
is open to abuse, though even here in a
lesser degree, perhaps, than other amusements.
Where it stands alone, is that in it a woman can
compete on equal terms with man.</p>

<p>Yacht-racing needs much study, and should not
be attempted till the ordinary art of sailing is
thoroughly understood. It is the most delightful
education in the world, the most interesting and
healthful. It becomes so engrossing you will not
rest till you understand the whole thing, and
know the why and wherefore of all the different
moves. It is not advisable to order a boat of your
own till you have served an apprenticeship as
"hand." Very few people are now contented to
go as "hand" or "crew," every one preferring to
"paddle his own canoe." Nevertheless it is delightful
to go in a well managed boat where you
have full confidence in the skipper, and a beginner
should certainly not be above it. She will then
see how much there is in "handling," and realize
how many races are won solely by clever man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>agement
and attention to small details. At any
rate do not attempt to have a boat of your own
for the first time until you have secured an
experienced racing skipper. When you have
done this be guided by him entirely to start with,
only you will do well to be still more particular
than he is in adhering to the Yacht Racing Association
Rules, which of course you should know
by heart. If you are racing do what the skipper
tells you instantly, and do not wait to ask the
reason first, do that afterwards.</p>

<p>The great secret of racing is to keep your wits
about you, do everything "smartly," never hesitate
or waver between two opinions at a critical
moment, for that will merely lose you the race.
The need of prompt decision is one of the most
exciting features of racing, now it has been
brought to such perfection. One <i>faux pas</i> and
you are done if the wind stops true, but on the
other hand it seldom answers to give up, as you
need never despair of the wind veering round
and coming to the rescue, even if you have made
a blunder. To be really good in a boat you
should have done some single-handed work, but
this is not to be recommended until you are well
grounded in the rudiments of sailing, or you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
very shortly be "well grounded" on something
harder still.</p>

<p>The single-handed matches in one-raters which
were witnessed in 1895 and 1896 were excellent
trials of skill, as was shown by the results. It is
impossible to exaggerate the difficulty of sailing
those boats single-handed in rough weather, for
it is a task worthy of a Sandow and a Carter
rolled into one, and the greatest <i>kudos</i> is therefore
due to those sportsmen who brought their boats
safely across the winning line. There were some
"lame ducks" too, through no fault of their own,
and many I regret to say made but a poor show
of their prowess. There is plenty of variety,
however, in racing without going to any extremes,
or attempting impossibilities like those single-handed
matches. A half-rater would be quite as
much as one man could manage properly in
rough weather.</p>

<p><i>ONE-RATERS AT COWES.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Every year affords fresh interests, as the type
of boat alters, for there is skill required to get
them into trim and learn their ways. Each individual
boat, too, wants different handling, and it
will often be a surprise to an adept in one boat, to
find himself quite adrift in another. Steering has
been steadily becoming more difficult hitherto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>but now I fancy there will be a return to the
fixed rudders we began with, which are much
easier to handle than the balanced ones of later
years. The business will not then be as fidgety,
or require such close attention, as with balanced
rudders your boat which may be ever so light on
her helm, will be constantly veering about and
getting off her course, if you do not keep an
undeviating watch on your steering. Of course
it all makes it more interesting, because more
difficult, but in a way it is not an advantage for
the helmsman to be entirely engrossed with his
steering, unless he can conscientiously rely on his
"crew" to do the rest.</p>

<p>To enjoy racing to the full you should have it
all in your own hands with no one to say you
"nay," otherwise that spirit of independence&mdash;so
rarely enjoyed by our sex&mdash;is lost. The sensation
of being master of your own vessel, with the
helm in your hand and a willing crew to do your
commands, unquestionably, these are elements
which should be experienced to be enjoyed. As
a man is dependent on his eye for shooting, his
hands for driving, his pocket for betting, so does
he depend on his wits for sailing. To be a good
skipper you must above all things have a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
head and plenty in it, for there is much to learn
and to keep up. Yacht racing has now attained
to a pitch of perfection verging on science, and
to succeed in it you must have observation, self-control,
perseverance, good ready judgment and
self-reliance, besides many other qualities too
numerous to mention, such as patience and cheerfulness.
There is nothing to compare to yacht-racing
in my opinion for a woman's sport, calling
into play as it does all these qualities, besides
giving the wholesome enjoyment of an ocean
life.</p>

<p>I began my racing career practically in 1886,
though I had had some experience with a little
boat called <i>Fairy</i>, which my father had bought
from Picket of Southampton. This boat had
been built for letting out to pleasure-parties, and
was nearly as broad as she was long. Some years
before this he&mdash;my father&mdash;had built the 60-tonner
<i>Vanguard</i>, and as he was a great connoisseur
on boats he made a good hit in buying the little
pleasure-boat, <i>Fairy</i>. She and the <i>Bird o' Freedom</i>
were the pioneers of that now famous body
the Solent classes. With some slight alterations
to the keel, and with the addition of a large jib
to the sail plan, little <i>Fairy</i> proved herself capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a><br /><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>of beating the <i>Bird o' Freedom</i>, which was then
the greatest flyer of the day. This caused some
surprise to the faculty&mdash;who were few in those
days&mdash;and some of them decided to try and beat
her the following season. Consequently 1886
saw the <i>Minima</i> and <i>Tootsie</i> added to the list, and
some jealous competitions ensued.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 661px;">

<p><i>READY FOR THE START.</i></p>

<p>(<i>MYNAH, HOOPOO, STORK, AND MOLLY.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Royal Southampton and Portsmouth Corinthian
Yacht Clubs came to the rescue and gave
fortnightly matches for the small craft, as well as
for the 25 and 30 footers. Then the fun grew
fast and furious, for the small boat racing having
been given the necessary fillip, the designers put
their best foot foremost and the sport was fairly
started. A motley crew it was that assembled
off the Town Quay every Saturday fortnight.
Most of the boats were of the nice little cruiser
type, slow as a country dinner party, nevertheless
so enshrouded in canvas as to present a most
sporting appearance. Any deficiency in design
was balanced by unlimited additions in canvas,
no expense being spared in sailcloth to make up
the necessary speed. And how zealous was the
competition! Life and death might have hung
on the issue, judging by the ardour and agility
displayed in the management of the boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every dog has his day," and this was the
heyday of the Dauntless Amateur. An eager,
perspiring, undefeated creature was he! Minus
hat and socks, having shed all superfluities in clothing,
he gallantly plied his task before the mast.
Any effort to persuade him further aft, or into
the "well," were unavailing. He loved to stand
boldly up forward, the wind running riot through
his hair, the poor boat shoving along all out of
trim, owing to his misplaced weight, while he
gallantly stood at attention, eager to signify that
he was "ready for anything." However we shall
see our hatless, sockless friend no more, his place
being now filled by the peerless Itchen ferryman
at thirty shillings a week.</p>

<p>The richest man now has the best boat, and if
he does not get it the first time he goes on building
till he succeeds. The same with the crew,
the man with well-lined pockets gets all the best
men by paying the best wages. But still even the
designers are not wholly responsible for what
their craft will turn out, as was proved by Sibbick
building the unsuccessful <i>White Rose</i> for the Duke
of York. Other cases I could also mention where
money was no object, and boat after boat untiringly
turned out for the same owner, yet without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
success. Then some lucky man may get a boat
from the same designer which will clear the
board for two or three seasons, her capacities
having been all unknown to the designer himself.</p>

<p>How we managed in those days of unlimited
canvas with only two hands remains a mystery.
What with the enormous topsail and all the extra
gear it entailed, the long spinnaker, boom, etc.,
and the largest mainsail that could be crammed
on, the wonder is that we ever gybed round a
mark at all, without capsizing the whole lot overboard.
The gear of course was very much
stouter and the boats slower on their helms than
they are now, or it could not have been done.
We have the same crew on a one-rater now that
we used to have on the 25-footer <i>Lil</i>, which is
most astonishing to think of when we compare
the two boats. True they are practically the same
<i>length</i>, but with what a difference in build. The
<i>Lil</i> was a regular ship with her enormous spars
and canvas, and her well timbered heavy hull and
large cabin, whereas these little one-raters are
mere cockle shells without half the amount of
gear, nor are they nearly so hard on it. Nevertheless,
anyone will tell you it is impossible now-a-days
to manage a one-rater properly with less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
than two hands, and <i>that</i> with only two sails instead
of four.</p>

<p>The first race I think ever sailed by women
was between us&mdash;my sisters and myself&mdash;in the
<i>Fairy</i>, and the Miss Coxes in their sister ship
<i>Colinette</i>, I believe the Miss Hammersleys also
formed part of the rival crew. I have but a
vague recollection of the whole thing, being too
young at the time really to grasp the situation in
its full value, or for it to make any great impression
on my mind, as I was always being taken
racing in some boat or other. In 1885, we were
again rivals in <i>Verena</i> and <i>Lil</i>, one of the Miss
Coxes always going in the former, and one of us
in the <i>Lil</i>. These were great wholesome boats
with enormous sails, and we managed to do a lot
of cruising between the races, which in those
days only took place once a week. The <i>Lil</i> had
quite a nice deep cabin which was the pride of
our lives, pictures being hung in every available
space, and little curtains and cushions to match.
Little <i>Fairy</i> meanwhile was "not quite dead yet,"
and in 1888 "came up smiling" to fight the
battle and the breeze in a resuscitated form.
That year she proved herself no mean opponent,
and succeeded in making the same figure of merit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as <i>Thalassa</i>, the champion of the previous year.
This success was due to a fin keel, an experiment
of my father's which has since been through
almost every imaginable variation, and still holds
sway in a modified form among the smaller
classes.</p>

<p>In 1887, Miss Cox built the <i>Madcap</i> at Payne's,
and divided the honour with <i>Thalassa</i>, also a
two-and-a-half-rater by Payne. The latter belonged
to Colonel Bucknill, whose daughters are
now so well known on the Solent. Miss Bucknill
is indeed much sought after as a helmswoman, and
with good cause, as she has learnt the work thoroughly
and is as proficient at the helm as she is
on the jib sheet. Her father has raced steadily
every season since 1886, and she has almost
always accompanied him and shared in the work
most gallantly. I cannot be quite sure if we
sailed <i>Fairy</i> or <i>Lil</i> that year, 1887, but I think
both went to the line, my brother also designed
a five-rater with but little success, being young
he had to buy his experience of course, and learnt
the advisability of going to Arthur Payne in
future.</p>

<p>The year 1889 was a memorable one for us,
as we were fortunate enough to possess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
champion two-and-a-half-rater by Payne. <i>Hummingbird</i>
was a charming boat in every respect,
comparatively roomy, a good sea boat, and a
wonderful performer to windward. She gained
twenty-five firsts and four seconds, out of thirty-eight
starts, and succeeded in routing three creations
of the famous G. L. Watson. It was one
of these, the <i>Thief</i>, which my sister, Mrs. Schenley,
had the misfortune to possess. A most
uncomfortable little craft it was. Only about
five foot beam, with decks like sieves, and we
were all crammed into little holes or cockpit
places with only our head and shoulders out, for
all the world like chickens coming out of an egg.
That was really my introduction to racing. I
had to work hard, as it was not the boat to take
people in who did nothing. We were fortunate
in securing Charlie Devis, who is now considered
almost if not quite the best skipper on the Solent.
He was then little more than a boy, so we were
all young and enthusiastic together, and despite
the many drawbacks I think we all enjoyed that
season thoroughly. At any rate we were nothing
daunted, and only waited till the next year to
renew our efforts in a five-rater of the same
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>This was also Lord Dunraven's d&eacute;but on the
Solent, and he was not much better off than we
were, having a sister ship to ours, by name <i>Cosette</i>.
Therefore, with the <i>Queen Mab</i>, <i>G.G.</i>, <i>Lady
Nan</i> (Mrs. Rudstan Reid), <i>Thalassa</i> and <i>Madcap</i>
(Miss Cox), we had to be content to compete for
second honours, the <i>Hummer</i> always carrying off
the first.</p>

<p>I might here put in a word in season, on the
evils resulting from keeping rival boats in the
family. The battles are bound to be re-fought
over the domestic board again in the evening,
and of the two the wordy war is by far the most
bitter and lasting. The envy and jealousy of the
defeated cannot fail to show itself, and even the
conqueror owes the other a grudge, for having
so much as dared to get in his way at the start!
We learnt the lesson in 1887, and have kept
studiously clear of each other's hunting grounds
ever since, even counselling our friends not to
put our fidelity to so severe a test as to join the
same class. It was this year that Mr. Philip
Perceval made his d&eacute;but with the <i>Lollypop</i>, a boat
he bought from Mr. St. Julien Arabin. Since
that time Mr. Perceval has been an enthusiastic
member of yacht-racing circles, and is now almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
as well known on the Solent as Calshot Castle.
Most lucky in his boats, whatever he touches
must turn to gold, and besides this phenomenal
luck, he has unrivalled skill at the helm and in
the general manipulation of the craft. So his
racing record must be indeed a remarkable one.
Perhaps some day he will be persuaded to publish
it, in all its branches.</p>

<p>At the end of this season, a ladies' match was
sailed in the sister ships <i>Cosette</i> and <i>Queen Mab</i>.
Miss Bucknill was at the helm of the former,
and Miss Harvey had the <i>Queen Mab</i>. It is
much to be regretted that Miss Harvey did not
persevere in her racing career, as she showed
much ability and came of a nautical family. Her
father, Mr. E. Harvey, was well known as one of
the original members of the squadron. The race
was very interesting and well managed, but far
be it from me to say which proved herself the
better steerer. Lord Dunraven and Mr. Perceval
who now had the racing fever, had both
built five-raters at Payne's and divided the honours
in that class. Mrs. Schenley determined to make
another experiment with Mr. Watson's design
in the five-raters. The <i>Valentine</i>, however, was
a worse failure than the <i>Thief</i> had been, <i>Glycera</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and <i>Alwida</i> being always first and second. The
stern chase became rather wearisome, and we did
not keep at it so steadily as we should have, only
starting twenty-six times to the others forty. We
managed to pick up five first and four second
prizes, chiefly in light weather. The <i>Babe</i>, Mr.
Payne's design, was champion of the two-and-a-half-raters,
and poor old <i>Hummer</i>, which had
served us in such good stead the year before, was
clearly worsted. She was beginning the season
in her old style, when the dreaded advent of the
<i>Babe</i> put an end to her prosperous career, and
she had a hard struggle till the end of the season
to keep up her old traditions. I sailed many
times on <i>Hummer</i> and <i>Cock-a-whoop</i>, my brother's
two-and-a-half-rater, and on the former I said
less, but thought the more, as my father's seamanship
was undisputed, and his tactics a wonder to
behold. That year the inventive genius of Mr.
Clayton, champion designer of the old length
classers, produced the <i>Dolphin</i>, also a two-and-a-half-rater.
She was looked at with decided disapproval
and some disgust by the rival faculty,
as her over-hang was considered a crafty mode of
cheating the rule. So it was, and continues to
be to this day in a still larger degree, but after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
all it is the designer's object to get as much as
he can out of the rule, without paying for it in
time allowance. Miss Cox and her sister, now
Mrs. Rudston Reid, both built two-and-a-half-raters,
which they sailed most conscientiously
but without much success. Miss Cox's <i>Mliss</i>
did the better of the two, the <i>Troublesome</i> not
being a morsel of use except in light air. However,
it was a very strong class, and of course
<i>every</i> one could not expect to win. Mrs. Schenley
was at last persuaded, in 1891, to give Payne
an order, and he proved himself fully equal to
the trust confided in him, by producing that
most delightful of boats the <i>Windfall</i>. Seaworthiness,
dryness, roominess, and lightness of helm
were some of her qualifications, besides her exceptional
speed. War to the knife ensued between
us and Mr. Perceval, who had likewise
got a new five-rater from Payne. We came out
of the fray each with thirty-four flags, <i>Windfall's</i>
string however being the better by six firsts, indicated
her superiority by six conquests out of
the forty deadly conflicts. These struggles have
never been renewed, the ordeal having been too
great for both sides.</p>

<p>The small pickings left over and above, namely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
nine first prizes and twelve second, were shared
by <i>Alwida</i> and <i>Iernia</i> respectively. The latter
boat, one of Fife's failures, was owned by that
genial Irishman, Mr. Langrishe, who had previously
sold the famous <i>Sam&aelig;na</i> to join the ranks
of the owners of the smaller classes, to which he
has remained faithful ever since. He placed his
confidence from the first in young Mr. Charles
Nicholson, who ultimately proved more than
equal to the trust reposed in him, and he
designed the <i>Dacia</i> in 1892. Miss Cox was
again at a discount with a most unattractive
two-and-a-half-rater, she called <i>Fiera</i>. This was
one of the hard-mouthed type, and wanted a
fresh wind and a strong man at the helm. She
gave a good account of herself however on such
occasions, and ran up a better record than <i>Mliss</i>.
Miss Harvey was the possessor of a very pretty
two-and-a-half-rater called <i>Undine</i>, built from a
design by Mr. Clayton. This last was still more
of an advance towards the type of the present
day, and no doubt would have made a good performance
then if she had been raced. She only
showed up once or twice, however, and so of
course never had a chance of getting into trim or
anything else. Possibly Miss Harvey was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
off by a collision she had with the <i>Windfall</i>
during the Cowes week. It was very unfortunate,
but not her fault as I can testify. Nevertheless
it was none the better for that, and I remember
pointing out the best place on the <i>Windfall</i> for
her to ram with the least danger. <i>Undine's</i> bowsprit
accordingly went clean through <i>Windfall</i>,
just forward of the mast, and then the two boats
got locked together and the spars began falling
about our ears. There was a strong wind and a
still stronger tide, and we were rapidly driven
under the bows of a large steamer <i>Gladwyn</i>. The
<i>Undine</i> had the inside berth between <i>Windfall</i>
and <i>Gladwyn</i>, and as <i>Windfall</i> got across the tide
she fairly ground poor little <i>Undine's</i> frail hull
till the timbers groaned again. Meanwhile the
gallant crew of the <i>Gladwyn</i> insisted on dragging
us ladies up over the bows, and this was the most
alarming part of all, as it was such a height.
The owner of the <i>Gladwyn</i>, who was in the
Squadron at the time, was much surprised a
little later to see a strange lot of rather dilapidated
females, being rowed ashore in his gig.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention that lively little
club at Bembridge, situated on a remote corner
of the Wight, near to which is the double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>attraction of a superior golf-links. The Bembridge
Sailing Club, or "B and S" Club, as it is
irreverently called, was started in 1889 by
Colonel Moreton and Major du Boulay. Some
of the rules were nothing if not eccentric, and I
am told the favourite hour for match sailing was
about midnight. The women were duly considered
in this club, and most ably did they
acquit themselves in the one design class.</p>

<p>Miss Sutton was tempted out to the more
easterly regattas, when she had a half-rater
called <i>Wee-Winn</i>, of which more later on. Miss
Moreton, Miss Hallows, and Mrs. Dudley Ward
and her daughters, were among the other Bembridge
sailoresses, though of course many more
came down in August to this cheerful little
resort.</p>

<p>The next year, 1892, both our family boats
were beaten by a new talent, young Mr. C.
Nicholson. It was a great thing bringing a new
brain to bear on the matter, as for the previous
five years Arthur Payne had held the whole
sway, and prior to that Mr. Clayton. These
boats went quite fast enough to make a good
race of it amongst themselves, and though they
assuredly were hard to beat yet they <i>were</i> beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
by the <i>Dacia</i> in the five-rater, and the <i>Gareth</i> in
the two-and-a-half-rater class. The latter was
the property of Mr. Henderson, who was indeed
fortunate, as he was a complete novice, to own
the champion of three seasons. Lord Dudley
bought <i>Dacia</i> from Mr. Langrishe in the middle
of the season for a fabulous price, nevertheless
the latter was generally to be seen at the helm.
Lord Dunraven's <i>Cyane</i>, from Mr. Payne's design,
was at the old game of shovelling the first prizes
into her locker, until <i>Dacia</i> came out and put a
stop to it. The pace of this flyer soon spread dismay
in the class, which was not very well filled
even at first, and soon no one could be got to start
against her, until she went down to Torbay to
show a boastful Scotch antagonist the way round
the course. The rivalry between North and
South is always exceedingly bitter, but latterly
the Scotchmen have not thought it <i>infra dig.</i> to
come to the South for their best designs in the
small classes. It would be more patriotic, to say
the least of it, if the best Clyde amateurs were
to challenge us in their home manufactures,
otherwise their triumphs are but reflected glories
after all.</p>

<p>A little stranger from over the water appeared
this year (1892), to the order of Miss Winnie
Sutton. <i>Wee Winn</i>, however, did not belie her
somewhat ambitious appellation, as is often the
case. On the contrary, she amply fulfilled it,
and the tiny Yankee did her country great credit,
and that in what we flattered ourselves to be a very
formidable class. She had nine competitors from
four different designers, and yet fairly walked
round the lot. Her performances were the signal
for further Yankee inroads, and 1893 saw two
American boats, namely <i>Meneen</i> and <i>Morwena</i>,
added to the list. So now there was an American
in all three classes from two-and-a-half downwards,
and to our shame be it said each one headed
her class. It was not till the year 1897 either,
that <i>Meneen</i> may fairly be said to have been outclassed,
her construction also was a masterpiece of
lightness and durability. Her record was forty
prizes in forty-nine starts, and this with seven
rivals, one of Mr. Nicholson's design and one of
Mr. Payne's included. Mrs. Hardie Jackson
constantly accompanied her husband in <i>Meneen</i>,
and was as at home on the water as she is known
to be in the saddle. This was not a propitious
year for South coast designers, as Fife held the
laurels in the five and likewise in the twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
class. The twenties were a new institution promoted
by Lord Dunraven, and they flourished for
four years as Solent classes, but last season (1897)
no new ones came to the line except towards the
end of July.</p>

<p>In 1893 the race programmes were almost too
well stocked, the scrimmage on the line to get
the start being a sight to behold, especially in the
one-rater class. There were considerably over a
dozen of these, and almost as many half raters,
all determined to get the start of the others over
the line, and that sometimes a very narrow one
as in the Hamble river. The <i>Morwena</i>, champion
of her class, was owned by one of the sisters of
Miss Winnie Sutton, and though her success did
not cause such a stir as <i>Wee Winn's</i>, she made
almost as good a record. Miss Cox's luck again
failed her in <i>Kismet</i>, a two-and-a-half rater built
by Payne. I believe she also was a very hard boat
to steer, in fact worse than <i>Fiera</i>. My brother
sailed the majority of races that year in <i>Gareth</i>,
whose performance was a good one but not so
good as the <i>Meneen's</i>. <i>Gareth</i> started five times
more than <i>Meneen</i> and won two more prizes, but
<i>Meneen's</i> figure of merit came out the highest.
These two consequently pretty well monopolised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the prizes, but a few being left for the other six,
of which <i>Kismet</i> picked up two firsts and six
seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. Jessop was the owner of the <i>Molly</i>, twenty
rater, and <i>Coquette</i>, half rater. He consequently
often required a helmswoman for the latter, which
office he kindly offered me. Little <i>Coquette</i> was
an extremely fast boat of Mr. Nicholson's design,
and made one of the longest string of flags ever
recorded. <i>Wee Winn</i>, fortunately for us, only
started eleven times that season. In the same
year (1893) the majority of boats and the largest
prize winners were of a good wholesome type,
but the three following seasons they went steadily
down hill in this respect. <i>Elf</i> was considered an
unsightly monster then, but there have been many
like her since, not a whit uglier or less exaggerated,
which have proved themselves also the fastest
movers. <i>Flat Fish</i> was a case in point. She was
most aptly named; indeed, I think the <i>Flounder</i>
would have been a still more appropriate designation.
She was put together with most wonderful
despatch by Fay and Co., from Mr. Soper's
design, for my sister, Mrs. Schenley. The first
two races she came to pieces, owing to the hurry
over her construction, and had to go back for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
repairs. To hear the flump of her bow on to the
water, it was marvellous that anything could hold
out; she was just the shape of a spoon forward,
and when driven against a head sea she naturally
made the splinters fly. Her nose was quite four
inches higher in the air by the end of the season,
in fact she presented the most cheeky appearance.
A most powerful boat in a breeze, in all senses
of the word except perhaps the individual frame,
she also required a Goliath to steer her. My
sister's and my united forces were unequal to the
task, and it used to amuse us to watch for the
signal of distress held out towards the end of a
race by the boastful amateurs, whom we requisitioned
to steer on hard windy days. They were
never keen to repeat the experiment, and if they
did, they were glad enough for us to take turns.
Our chief antagonist was <i>Fleur-de-Lys</i>, built by
Fife and owned by Major Montgomery, one of
the few lucky yachtsmen who have not followed
up their successes, although a dweller on the scene
of action. Lady Sophia Montgomery occasionally
accompanied her husband, and took a keen
interest in the fray and kept a jealous eye on the
records of the rival craft. Theirs was undoubtedly
the better "all round" boat, as <i>Flat Fish</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a><br /><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>no more good than a barge in light weather, although
she was conscientiously sailed in all the
races for which she was entered. In 1894 two
new aspirants for yachting fame joined the ranks,
namely, the Hon. Mrs. Oliphant and Miss Lord.
I can hardly say which has proved herself the
keenest sailor. Mrs. Oliphant was most fortunate
in securing an excellent two-and-a-half rater
from Sibbick, called <i>Zivolo</i>, which made a very
good record, taking twenty-nine flags in thirty-six
starts. Although the boat was her own property,
she very wisely got others to steer at first,
though she always accompanied the ship. Now
she no longer needs assistance, and though not
possessing a boat of her own this year, she has had
several mounts on other peoples. The <i>Rosemary</i>,
a formidable customer to steer was in her hands
the latter part of this season, and though a slow
boat Mrs. Oliphant often led the fleet in her, and
won two or three prizes. Miss Lord has had a
succession of one-raters since her d&eacute;but in 1895.
She favoured Soper's design at first, but latterly
has adopted Sibbick's. All her boats have been
large prize winners.</p>

<p><i>FLAT FISH.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1895, yacht-racing was distinctly the fashionable
sport. Lord Dunraven was no doubt in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
great measure responsible for this, he having persuaded
several friends to join the twenty-rater
class. Lord Lonsdale owned one of these, Lord
Dudley another, Prince Batthyany Stratmann, a
pretty boat painted blue, and the unfortunate
Baron von Zedtwitz, who was subsequently
drowned off his twenty-rater, the <i>Isolde</i>.</p>

<p>Even Royalty patronized the Solent classes.
The Duke of York had a one-rater built at Sibbick's
in less than a week, in which he took a
great interest though he did not venture himself
to join in the sport. The <i>White Rose</i> was, however,
in good hands, being most ably sailed by his
equerry, the Hon. Derek Keppel. She was not
a success, however, and when Mr. Keppel, who
was called away at the end of August, confided her
to me, I made but a poor show with her, gaining
only one first in tour starts. Miss Cox was well
to the fore in the same class, also having got her
craft from Sibbick. She made a string of
twenty-five flags, eleven of which were firsts.
My brother had bought an unsuccessful one-rater,
he re-named <i>Fusee</i>, the year before. He and I
sailed this little boat in several races, I steering
and he doing the work. It <i>was</i> fun, and the
boat was well suited to this game as she was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
good for light water, directly it blew up at all
she was passed in spite of all we could do. So
when my brother went abroad at the end of June
I got a boy to help, and sailed in the light wind
races throughout the season. I thoroughly enjoyed
myself and got ten prizes out of twenty
starts, though poor little <i>Fusee</i> was invariably
beaten on a reach except in the lightest air, and
had to make up all her time on the "beats."
That August was a busy month, for on looking
back I find I raced every day, Sunday not excepted,
as we used to have duels in <i>Fusee</i> and
<i>White Rose</i> with amateur crews. The class to
which these belonged (one-raters) was then and
has remained the most popular of all classes on
the Solent. Once at Yarmouth, fourteen of us
started together over the line. It was grand fun
and I was very proud of leading at the end of
the first round in little <i>Fusee</i>, but unfortunately
the wind dropped completely in the second
round, and only a few of us managed to complete
the course at all. I think Mr. Paget's
<i>Soper</i> got in first, and Miss Cox's <i>Mavis</i> second.</p>

<p>1896 was also a great one-rater year, and Miss
Cox had the honour of leading the whole fleet in
almost every race she sailed. She had returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to her old ally, Arthur Payne, who designed her
the <i>Speedwell</i>. No praise is too high for this
little champion, for she still holds pride of place
and has proved herself as seaworthy as she is fast.
I never steered such a wonderful boat, to windward
she positively edged along in the teeth of
the wind and made all the others look foolish, as
she outpointed them to such a ridiculous extent.
I often sailed the old <i>Meneen</i> that year, and she
also was dependent on her windward powers for
her success, as being much shorter than the
others she could not be expected to reach with
them. This was well shown at some races at
Seaview in August, when we headed the <i>Florence</i>
(Sibbick's crack owned by the Marquise de
Serramezzana) every time to windward, whereas
she would pass us again on the reach. The
<i>Florence</i> got two firsts and one second, and we
secured two seconds and one first out of the three
races. Mrs. Schenley had bought the <i>Corolla</i>, a
success of the previous season. We did very
well with her until about the end of July, when
<i>Tatters</i> became too much for us, some slight
alteration having given her the advantage over
us. <i>Florence</i> then came out, and we left those
two to fight it out to the bitter end. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
boats, both of which were of Sibbick's design,
were extremely fast, though they were not
remarkably close-winded. Lord Albemarle built
<i>Valeria I.</i> at Payne's, and I sailed in her many
times but failed to score, there were certainly
numerous and formidable rivals and <i>Valeria</i> came
rather late to the fray. It must be an unlucky
name I think, as <i>Valeria II.</i> has not proved any
better, though she is a beautiful boat and great
things were expected of her, being Payne's
design. <i>Tatters</i>, with Miss Lord at the helm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
won first prize in the Ladies' race (promoted by
the <i>Gentlewoman</i>) on August 4th, Mrs. Oliphant
who had a good mount in the <i>Florence</i> was
second, Miss Bucknill being third in <i>Meneen</i>, I
fourth in <i>Valeria</i>, my sister last in <i>Mem Sahib</i>.
There was a fresh wind, and as the harbour was
full of yachts, and the course was all amongst
them, considerable skill was required in the
handling. There were happily no casualties.
Another ladies' race in one-raters, with a diminished
crew of one amateur, was got up one
evening at Cowes by Lord Harrington. There
was a fine scrimmage getting on board, most of
the women or their boats being late, the starting-gun&mdash;a
12-bore&mdash;was fired off in one of the
bathing machines, regardless of the entreaties of
the competitors for time. I was dragged on
board the wrong boat at the last minute, my
"mount" being late, and off we went after
<i>Speedwell</i>, but she was already a speck in the distance,
and we found we should never catch her
again. My sister and I had a deadly encounter
in <i>Tartar</i> and <i>Bodagh</i>, and after jostling each other
round and round and tacking and filling in a remarkable
manner only known to ourselves, I came
out the best of it and she gained third honours.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1897, Mrs. Schenley joined the one-design
class&mdash;with <i>Cresta</i>&mdash;- started the year before by
Major Colville and Colonel Bucknill. These
boats proved very popular and much good racing
has resulted. They are ugly but wholesome,
not very fast but answer their purpose well. We
did not race very assiduously that season as we
were often otherwise engaged. <i>Cresta</i> won us
about fourteen prizes, in thirty starts I think.
Many women sailed in this class, Mrs. Parry and
Mrs. Tower constantly accompanying their husbands,
also Mrs. Towers Clark and Mrs. Alwyne
Greville were occasionally to be seen on the
<i>C'lerk</i> and <i>Eileen</i>. These latter, however, never
ventured to take the helm, though they were
much attached to the sport and nothing daunted
by weather. The boats owned by women this
year were the <i>Fairy</i>, Miss Lord, <i>Cresta</i>, Mrs.
Schenley, and <i>Speedwell</i>, Miss Cox, while Mrs.
Oliphant was Queen Regent on the <i>Rosemary</i>.
My sister, Miss Hughes, constantly sailed the
<i>Meneen</i> and <i>Speedwell</i>, but she will never make
such a record as she did with the <i>Viva</i>, half-rater,
lent her by Mr. Wood, which was one of
the largest prize-winners and most successful of
her class ever floated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-raters are too small for my taste, and I
think a two-and-a-half, as the boats are built now,
is the best size for a woman. Possibly the day
may come back when the five-raters will be as
easy on their helms as they were in 1891. My
sister tells me she steered <i>Forella</i>, five-rater, in quite
a fresh wind this season and had no difficulty in
managing her, so perhaps I am not too sanguine
in anticipating more sport for us in this class.</p>

<p>My ideal mode of yachting would be to have
a new two-and-a-half-rater whenever the old one
was worsted, with a five-rater perhaps now and
then to vary the monotony. A fifty-ton steamer,
or one perhaps a little smaller, to act as convoy
is essential, and it should be fast and have a good
saloon, and a couple of rooms to change in if
needed. Cowes is the most convenient <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i>
from a racing point of view, being very
central with regard to the more frequent regattas.
Racing is not a cheap amusement, but then,
nothing nice ever is. To put it roughly, the
two-and-a-half-rater would cost &pound;300 to build,
and &pound;100 to "run." The steamer &pound;2,500 to
build, and &pound;300 to "run," and the little house at
Cowes, one or two hundred for the season. Of
lesser items connected with racing there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a><br /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>several, the numerous club subscriptions for one
thing being no small matter. The expenses of
yacht-racing have been steadily on the increase,
and I hope now they have attained their maximum.
We have had sixteen racing boats in
the family during the last twelve years, our last
effort being made in the poor man's class, the one
designers, which fact speaks for itself. Many
others are in the same hole as ourselves, and are
glad enough to find a means of racing without
so much expense. The one-design class was
specially instituted to meet this demand, as the
boat only costs &pound;200 to begin with, and all the
costs, wages, etc., are limited and prescribed by
the rules. They are fine little craft too, stiff and
dry and light-helmed, in fact very suitable boats
for a woman to start her racing in. About fifty
prizes are given by Solent clubs for this class,
though, of course, they are not so well catered
for elsewhere.</p>

<p>A trip to the Westward at the end of the Ryde
week is a pleasant change, the regattas at Torquay
and Dartmouth being quite unique spectacles.
I know of nowhere in England where
ceremony is so lightly disregarded, or where conviviality
is so essentially the order of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The late Prince Henry of Battenberg did
honour to these festivities in 1894, and won
himself golden opinions by his geniality, and
genuine enjoyment of the fun. He asked my
brother to sail his twenty-rater, <i>Asphodel</i>, during
this time, and proved himself not only a lenient
master, but a kind friend and a keen sportsman.</p>

<p>My chronicle is now at an end. I am conscious
of having made many omissions, and though
my love of yachting makes even writing on it a
welcome task, still I feel the futility of my endeavours
to portray adequately the pleasures of
the sport, which it has been my life interest to
enjoy.</p>

<h2><a name="PUNT_RACING" id="PUNT_RACING">PUNT RACING.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-067.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first punts on our river&mdash;the
Medway&mdash;were simply flat-bottomed
shoe-shaped boats, which were built
to slide over the mud, and were principally
used by muddies and watermen, or by
those people who, having boats anchored off the
shore, required something they could push over
the intervening flat. With a wind astern or on
a slight incline in the mud, the slipping process
was simple, the happy owner of one of these primitive
punts finding himself on the river with but
little trouble. A friend of ours at Gillingham
determined to build himself one in his own dining-room
to use for rowing, and being of an ingenious
turn of mind, as he had to pull the punt up into
his garden every time she was used, he added a
detachable wheel under the bow, and then by
fixing her oars on either side of the gunwale as
handles, he was able to wheel her up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the causeway with the greatest ease. This friend
had long since found out that the Gillingham
boy, boats, and mud did not agree. He it was
who first saw the possibility of the punt being
turned into a sailing boat, and when this idea
occurred to him he started building the <i>Snowflake</i>,
an ordinary mud punt with square chime, a centre
plate and lug, which in its turn gave place to
another named <i>Crystabel</i>. A small club was then
thought of, for the purpose of opening up the
healthy enjoyment of punt racing to the working
class, and it was soon formed and my husband invited
to become Commodore. A small subscription
of half-a-crown, and a shilling entrance fee,
made it possible for the working man to enter, and
most races were arranged to suit his convenience.
The money was paid to the officer of the day
before the start, and only by the boats competing.</p>

<p><i>PUNTS RACING.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Punts in those days only cost from &pound;4 to &pound;5,
and we soon had several. Our eldest son was
promised a boat as soon as he could swim, which
hurried matters, and a new punt was laid down,
finished and christened <i>Nelson</i> before the summer
was out, but this, as well as all the earlier
ones, leaked. Then a real start was made. My
husband being fired with the idea of improving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>the breed, began cutting out and drawing many
models preparatory to building. The greenhouse
was found to be the only place long enough, so
the boat throve though the flowers faded, the
pots grew chips and copper tacks to the despair
of the gardener, and we had no show of flowers
that winter. In the early spring, the new creation
was taken into the little wood close at hand,
and there with the sweet primroses and bluebells
growing all round her was turned bottom up for all
who were interested to come and sand-paper her
whenever there was a "spell oh" in the course
of the day's work. She was then finished off with
a scarlet coat, and carried on the shoulders of
four men in procession to the beach, where the
christening ceremony was to be performed. At
the moment, the family being full of Lear's Nonsense
Songs and Stories, the little girl insisted she
must have lavender water tinged with pink. So
this of course was supplied. The boys ran up
flags and hurrahed enough for the launching of a
first-class cruiser, the men gave a big shove, and
the little girl broke her bottle, calling out good
luck to <i>Scarlet Runner</i>. This punt never leaked
a drop, and sailed splendidly for her size, though
unlike the accommodating bicycle of a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
song, she would <i>not</i> hold two, and in a sea little
but a man, mast and sail could be seen. At this
time bigger punts were built, principally by Mr.
Baker, a fruit-grower of Gillingham, who introduced
a stronger, larger type with much higher
freeboard. From his little yard were launched
<i>Tar Baby</i>, <i>Go By</i>, <i>Satan</i>, and lastly <i>Black Bess</i>,
which held her own against all comers. The
blacksmith also built <i>Ethel</i> and <i>Mud Puppy</i>, so
that altogether there was a nice little class. <i>Scarlet
Runner</i>, after several alterations, ultimately beat
<i>Black Bess</i>. Then came a decision to sail under
Y.R.A. rules, and bring the boats up to half-rating.
This in most cases meant building afresh,
so once more Commodore started chipping bits
of nice soft wood, till the desired shape for the
new punt to hold two was arrived at. We then
hunted for a building shed, and at last settled on
a loft over the stables, a nasty draughty place, but
one with plenty of room. The punt was drawn
out life size on the floor in chalk, and five nice
fir planks were procured from the village carpenter
for the bottom. The centre plank was one
inch thick, and the two on either side three-quarter;
a grown oak knee formed the stem, and
another the stern post, and to these a strong rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was fastened to make into a tourniquet to give
the proper rocker to the bottom. Every day as
it grew dusk, off we all went to that horrid cold
loft, lit up the lamps and started an abominable
din of hammering, a boy generally buzzing round
the while with a broom to clear away some of
the chips. When I grew tired of crouching and
holding a hammer to the rivets, then the boy was
victimised. The wheelwright came to lend a
hand in the evenings, and envy seized my soul as
I watched him send home screw after screw as if
they were going into so much butter. Commodore
would not even leave his work to come in
to dinner, and looking back now, I really think
it must have been a very uncomfortable time.
The sides were made out of one wide plank of
Kauri pine without a join. This was riveted to
the beams and angles of Bull metal, and a devoted
friend put in the mast step, which to this day
holds all the water it catches, sending up a spirt
as the mast drops into place. The centre board
case gave a good deal of trouble, but even this
gave way to patience. The seams were gone over
with the greatest care with putty and varnish, as
we were determined she should not leak, and the
mixture proved most satisfactory, as whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
water the punt shipped ran out of the centre
board case, and never a drop came through the
seams. I was greatly distressed when the well
was put in. I really could not see how I could
be expected to sit in any comfort on a butcher's
tray, which it resembled. The idea in itself no
doubt was lovely, for any water coming on board
emptied itself out of the tray, which was flush
with the top of the centre-board case, down the
case, thus making the boat absolutely unsinkable.
But fancy sitting for hours with one's knees up to
one's chin in a calm. I argued for a long time, and
was made to sit in position over and over again,
my husband declaring it was quite comfortable,
but I could not see it. I agreed, however, to waive
the question till the punt should be afloat. So a
light deck was put on her, with canvas strained
and painted over it, and then she was turned bottom
up on the tressels, and Commodore planed,
whittled and sand-papered till every line was
beautifully fair. The rudder was shipped on to
the transom on the curved Bull metal gudgeons,
so that if it touched the bottom it slid up the gudgeons
without coming off. It could also be triced
up with a line when sailing in shallow water.</p>

<p>At last came the happy day for launching,
when a cart was brought up from the farm filled
with straw, and pulled up close under the door
of the loft, the punt being lowered away carefully
on the top. In procession we followed
down the old road to the brickfields, the little
girl<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> bringing up the rear in her chair. When
the cart had been backed as close down the river
as possible, Sweet Pet dashed her bottle of wine
against the boat's side, and with a little excited
shriek, called out good luck to <i>Sea Maiden</i>, as the
punt plunged into the water.</p>

<p>That same evening, <i>Sea Maiden's</i> sail plan was
calculated, and drawn out. We have very strong
ideas of our own on the sit of a sail, and had
proved by many experiments that a sail that sits
dead flat is a mistake, but to make sure, we made
one more trial with a lot of little paper vanes
stuck on pins, and setting our sail, pinned these
right across, shifting them time after time as we
sailed about. Then we came to the conclusion
that there should be a fairly flat after-leach
curving very gradually to the luff, and that seams
carried across the sail in the direction of the
wind, caused less deflection than the usual seams
up and down. Now the carpet was rolled up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the drawing-room, and our union silk cut and
ruled with the greatest care, each seam with
half-an-inch curve towards the luff over-lapping
to form pockets for the light ash battens, and a
nice round after-leach and foot. Then came the
machining, which was simple enough, and fell to
my lot, and in time the sail was bundled up and
sent off to be roped, with strict injunctions that
it was to be sewn loosely to the rope, especially
the luff. When it came home it was set between
a tree and a fence, where through the early
spring it flapped gently up and down whenever
there was a light breeze, stretching and improving
itself in the sun. Sailing was then started
in real earnest, so that we might learn the ways
of the boat, and get all the gear to work with
the least amount of trouble, before the racing
came on. Our balance-jib looked after itself,
being laced to a light ash boom. In going to
windward the sheet was always fast, and when
off the wind it could be goosewinged in a second
by letting the sheet run, and pulling on the lee-guy,
so that what little we lost in the size of the
sail was counteracted by the speed with which
we could handle it.</p>

<p><i>PUNTS RACING.</i></p>

<p>(<i>THE RACE.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>That butcher's tray <i>was</i> uncomfortable, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a><br /><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>there was not a thing in the boat I could lay
hold of to keep myself on board. Only those
who have sailed punts can imagine the rapidity
of their movements, and my first attempts were
certainly exciting, as only having the tiller to
hold on to, which naturally was not of much
use, it came over with me. I several times
nearly went backwards into the river. After
this, Commodore cut a square out of the well,
so that my feet could just fit down, and framed
it in with water-tight canvass, and so altered
matters that my real joy in sailing began. The
feeling of being run away with in a boat is glorious,
and a good punt is hard to beat at this.
The excitement keeps you in a glow, though the
water breaks all round and over you. The first
race in which I steered we won, and then began
a record on our own river. Punt after punt was
built to beat us, but still <i>Sea Maiden</i> came in first.
Emboldened by our wins, we took her round to
the Thames to try her against the half-raters.
Our first race was over the circular course off the
Royal Corinthian Club, at Erith, in a very strong
wind. As we stepped on board the <i>Sea Maiden</i>,
the waterman, from a little grey steamer that was
being repaired, begged us to be careful, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
blowing very hard and we should find more sea
on the other side. Mr. Hope thinking <i>Lotus'</i>
mainsail too big for her, hoisted one belonging
to a dinghy, the other boats starting closely
reefed. <i>Lotus</i> led the first round, with <i>Sea Maiden</i>
a close second, but the wind gradually lightening,
<i>Lotus</i> increased her lead. We saw it was absolutely
necessary to shake out our reefs, which we
dared not do whilst close-hauled, so we could
only wait impatiently as the stern of the leading
boat grew smaller and smaller. At last we got
round the buoy, and out came our reefs in a
minute. The effect was magical, and we ran up
to <i>Lotus</i> hand over hand, till by the time we
reached Crayford Ness mark we were close astern.
Mr. Hope could not stand this, so began shaking
out his reefs, but we now had a turn to windward
and at once passed him, and throughout the remainder
of the race kept the lead. The boat was
looked at with great curiosity as we came alongside
the causeway. She was called a "Thing," an
"Eggbox," and other uncomplimentary names,
but all agreed that she could go in a breeze.</p>

<p><i>SEA MAIDEN.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Next day was almost a perfect calm. A racing
tide was running down the wind to Greenhithe,
and we were all mortally afraid of being drifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>over the line before gun-fire. Nevertheless, we
thought it best to risk it, and consequently stood
away close hauled right into the middle of the
stream, the other boats meanwhile keeping in a
little eddy close to the shore. When the gun
did go they were over the line long before us,
but we were in the middle of a swinging tide
which swept us away at four miles an hour,
whilst the others were all trying to work out of
their little slack. On reaching Greenhithe we
found we had left our instructions behind, and
could not remember on which hand to leave the
buoy, so to make no mistakes rounded first to
port and then to starboard. Unfortunately
<i>Lotus</i> came in sight as we rounded the wrong
way, and having also left her instructions behind
was led astray. Our very light draught enabled
us to skirt the mud out of the tide all the way
back, and brought us in first again with a very
long lead. Our third race was sailed in a
moderate breeze which fell to almost a dead
calm at the last. <i>Lotus</i> led for the three rounds
of the circular course, and do what we would it
seemed impossible to pass her; however, at the
very last, a stretch of strong tide had to be
crossed to reach the line, <i>Lotus</i> left the slack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
first, sailing straight for the mark. Seeing it
was our last chance we kept away in the slack
much further down, then started across keeping
the line on our weather beam and the tide on
the lee-bow, we slowly drifted crab-wise across
the broad stretch of river. It was a moment of
intense excitement, the wind had died down to
a mere breath and a crowd of tugs, huge steamers
and drifting barges were coming up with the
tide, we had to pick our way through these as
we both converged towards the bobbing flag-boat.
<i>Lotus</i>, seeing her mistake, set a spinnaker
and tried to stem the tide, but it was too late,
and again <i>Sea Maiden</i> took first gun, and the
Muriel Challenge cup for the best of three races.</p>

<p>The punt went on winning after this, till we
were afraid of being disliked on our own river,
so put her in a railway truck and took her down
to the Solent, where the storm drum was up and
a sou'wester blowing in heavy squalls. As we
started across from Portsmouth Harbour, we
reefed down small, for the sea was the biggest I
had ever sailed the boat in, the waves breaking
completely over us, filling my bucket and drenching
us both to the skin. A strong tide too was
running to windward, but we got into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
shelter of Wooton Creek in a very short time,
and were most hospitably received in the Canoe
camp and dried bit by bit. Our first race on the
Solent was at Ryde, for the hundred-guinea cup,
presented by Mr. West. And here we met our
old enemy, <i>Lotus</i>, which had been doing wonders
against the Isle of Wight craft.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Hope exclaimed as we
came up, "Hullo, Mrs. Wyllie, I think the race
lies between the Thames and the Medway today."
Now this was most unlucky, as we have
always found that wherever any bragging is done
we are sure to lose; and so it proved. Keeping
an eye on the time ball on Ryde Pier, <i>Sea Maiden</i>
was first over the line, the wind was terribly
light with a nasty bobbly swell which seemed to
knock the life out of her. The boats with heavy
lead keels went through it better than she did,
and it was not long before we were passed.
After rounding the Stourbridge it was a close
pinch to Gillicker point, with the tide racing out
and the sun blazing and dazzling one's eyes with
its reflection in the oily heaving water. It was a
weary time, and as we became mixed with the lagging
members of the large fleet of one-raters which
had started before us, our chances for that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were lost. It took the best part of a day to sail the
one round. The Thames and Medway were not
in it, <i>Sea Maiden</i> finishing an inglorious seventh.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/illus-088.jpg" width="636" height="384" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>PUNTS RACING.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Next day there was a little more wind, and
<i>Lotus</i> came in a very good first, <i>Sea Maiden</i> second,
and <i>Wee Winn</i> third. The moment the race was
over, the helm was put up and we ran across to
Portsmouth hard, and in two hours from the
finish, the boat was safely placed on the truck
that was to take her to Burnham-on-Crouch,
where we were to do some racing, and where
<i>Lotus</i> took first each time. There we had a
week of first-class sport, some of the races being
very exciting, one especially so, for there was a
long run in a heavy sea, ending up in a jibe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
round the buoy which some did, and some did <i>not</i>
do. It was a breathless moment as the boom came
over and we careered away at a tremendous pace,
the boat rocking wildly from side to side, and the
waters seething all round and over us. Suddenly
I found I had no grip on the helm, the rudder
having floated up on our following wave. She
broached to at once, and though, thanks to
Commodore's prompt letting go of the sheet, we
managed to save a capsize, it was a close thing.</p>

<p>That year we sailed twenty-seven races, winning
fifteen firsts, six seconds, and two thirds, and
ending the season on the Medway with a series
of matches in which we all changed boats and
crews. It was on a lovely autumn afternoon
that we anchored our barge yacht under the
wood as committee boat, with tea, something
stronger, dry clothes, and a party of friends on
board. In every case and with every crew
<i>Sea Maiden</i> came in first, till we persuaded Lord
Charles Beresford to sail his <i>Undaunted</i> with our
sail, when she at once turned the tables. Next
year there were a number of new punts built,
namely: <i>Mosquito</i>, <i>Star Fish</i>, <i>Water Lily</i>, <i>Princess
May</i>, and <i>Tartar</i>. The Royal Engineers, too,
built the <i>Terrible</i> and <i>Powerful</i>, sister ships, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
long overhanging sterns, and Captain Mareney,
R.E., with his own hands built <i>B&eacute;b&eacute;</i>, which has
proved the fastest of her class. In a strong wind
the <i>B&eacute;b&eacute;'s</i> speed is something quite phenomenal,
and one race she sailed in a hard gale, surprised
everyone who saw her. Mr. G. C. Kerr's punt,
<i>L'Esp&eacute;rance</i>, besides being good-looking, sails
very fast; and on one occasion, in a light wind,
beat the seventeen-ton, <i>Buccaneer</i>, in a race to
Sheerness and back, without time allowance.
Owing to the drawing of our punt, which appeared
in the <i>Field</i>, there have been many imitations
of our flat-bottomed class started in different
parts of the world. The Puffins at Plymouth, a
little fleet at Weymouth, the new class at Southampton,
and individual boats in Scotland, Northumberland,
Anglesea, Florida, and even distant
Hong Kong. There was a rumour that a challenger
for the Seawanhaka Cup should take the
shape of a long flat punt, and for this purpose a
drawing was made by one of our most celebrated
designers, but the Canadian holders of the cup
have accepted the American challenge, instead
of that of the Minima Yacht Club, so, this
spring, the sound of the hammer will not be
heard in our loft.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_RED_DEER_LAND" id="IN_RED_DEER_LAND">IN RED DEER LAND.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-093.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Books</span> and Magazine articles dealing
with the Chase and the habits of the
Red deer, are so many and so excellent
that I feel diffident about attempting
to say anything on a subject that has been so
thoroughly thrashed out. In old days, or at any
rate twenty-five years ago, very few people
wended their way Westward in the months of
August and September, to see what has now become
such a popular sport. The crowds at the
present time are now enormous, often worse than
the Quorn fields, and the riders all full of zeal
and desperately anxious not to miss anything
from find to finish, thus often causing the Master
no little anxiety, and trying his patience sadly.</p>

<p>In case my readers are not acquainted with
the method in which stag-hunting is conducted,
I will try to give a brief history of a day's sport.
In the first place the deer must be harboured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
that is "slotted" or tracked into covert, and this
requires great knowledge of woodcraft on the
part of him to whom the business is entrusted.
The harbourer's business is to find out that his
deer is a warrantable, <i>i.e.</i>, a runnable, stag, which
he can tell by the size of the slot, or footprint
on the ground, and he must also make sure that
his quarry has not passed through the covert.
To do this he must search carefully for a slot
leading out of the wood, or if the covert be too
large he must make good as many of the paths
round where he thinks his deer is lying, as he
can. The difference between the slot of a hind
and a stag is almost imperceptible to the ordinary
eye, but if closely observed it will be noticed
that the slot of a stag is larger and has a wider
heel and blunter toes, also that an old heavy
deer has his toes frequently uneven in length,
while a hind's toe is pointed, and she has a narrow
heel. In an old deer there is generally also
a little space open between her toes. The
harbourer can tell whether a stag or hind has
been feeding, and though the signs believed in
by some are disputed, one infallible test is
whether the ash shoots have been nibbled or
not. For while the hinds and young deer do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
not affect them, stags have a perfect passion for
them, and the delicacy seems to be as irresistible
to them as oysters and caviare are to a human
gourmet.</p>

<p>The harbourer generally goes to the scene of
action the day before the meet, and gleans what
information he can from those whose knowledge
he can rely on. With regard however to the
feeding ground of the deer, he will do well to
depend entirely on his own eyes, and to form his
own conclusions. Next morning he must be
afoot in the small hours, and look for any fresh
slot pointing towards the covert, made by the
deer returning from feeding. Should he see
what he thinks belongs to a warrantable deer, he
must next make sure the animal has not gone
through the covert, and if the woods be very
large, he must try and localise him as much as
possible. The late Miles, who was the harbourer
in the Devon and Somerset country for so many
years, was a marvel in doing this, for he seemed
to know the habits of the deer as well as they
did themselves. His loss to the hunt was
irreparable, for apart from the harbouring, he
was of unbounded assistance during the run, and
often when the deer seemed hopelessly lost, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Master and huntsman were in despair, have I
heard Miles's whistle and his cheery holloa,
saving the day at the eleventh hour.</p>

<p>For the business of tufting, as finding the deer
is called, four or five couples of the strongest
hounds are required, as they will have to run
with the pack afterwards. Also, it is well to
select those hounds most inclined to throw their
tongues, as their deep notes are more than welcome
in the big coverts, where they get out of
sight. If the deer has been well harboured and
is inclined to leave covert quickly, so much the
better, but patience is often sorely wanted in stag
hunting, when a cunning old deer will double
back into covert time after time, and turn out
his younger relations to try and get hounds off
his line. We will suppose, however, that the
deer has chosen to break covert quickly, and the
welcome sound of Anthony's horn means that
the body of the pack, till now kennelled in a
convenient barn or stable, will be laid on. If
the deer has chosen a good line, that is over the
forest, we must pull ourselves together and save
our horses wherever possible, knowing that we
may gallop for eighteen or twenty miles or more.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how two or three miles over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
holding ground will steady a field, and weed
them to within reasonable bounds. I consider
Exmoor the worst possible country for a stranger
to take his own line, the best man to hounds on
earth cannot tell some of the crossings by
instinct, many of the combes having only one
even decent crossing, and that has to be negotiated
with care. Most people, however, seem to
come down with the idea that Exmoor is one
vast bog, which is all nonsense, for most of it is
quite rideable, or at any rate you can pick your
way over it. The crossings are the worst drawbacks
to riding straight to hounds. A large majority
of the field ride to points, and most annoying
it is, after you have galloped your hardest at the
tail of hounds, to see a batch of tourists who
have been piloted by someone who knows every
inch of the country, and who has guessed the
stag's point, with comparatively fresh horses,
while your own, no matter how carefully you
have nursed him, has pretty nearly had enough.</p>

<p>A deer will nearly always soil once, if not
oftener during a run, and it is marvellous how a
plunge in one of the many streams, or a roll in
a peat hole, will refresh him. Stags, especially
the older and fatter ones, generally lie down after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they have run for a time if not pressed, that is if
hounds are not laid on at once, and the master
generally gives a big heavy deer a little law. A
fresh find is a beautiful sight, and the tricks and
dodges of a wily old stag would fill many chapters.
To anyone fond of seeing hounds work,
and not only anxious for a gallop, the sight of
hounds trying to pick out the line of their deer,
when he has gone up or down stream, is alone
worth going out for. It is extraordinary how
long a deer's scent will hold on the moor. It is
no uncommon thing for hounds to hunt up to, and
kill their stag, after he has been two hours ahead
of them.</p>

SOMERSET PACK.</i></p>

</div>

<p>One thing in hunting the red deer impresses
people very strongly who have only seen foxhunting,
and that is the way hounds tail on the
moor. Several explanations of this are given.
One is that the deer running in a straighter line
than the fox, the fastest hound gets in front and
stays there, others say that it is easier to get
through the heather in a string, and again some
hold that the scent of a deer being very sweet,
hounds run one behind another to get it all.
When they do carry a head, the sight of the big
hounds, none under twenty-four-and-a-half inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a><br /><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>and all unrounded, racing over the heather, is a
very fine one. Deer almost invariably die in the
water, either in one of the numerous streams or
rivers, or going to sea. In the last case they have
to be followed by boatmen, and are brought to
shore and killed. This is the greatest drawback
to stag hunting, but it is no good being sentimental
about it. The deer do an immense amount of
damage to the farmer's crops, and if they were
not killed in the chase they would very soon be
shot, and stag hunting would be no more, so that
my advice to those who cry out about the cruelty
to "the poor dear stag," when they see him
being ignominiously towed to shore, is to stay at
home, so that their feelings may not be hurt by
the sight.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how the more ignorant portion
of the large field of strangers, who condescend to
honour Exmoor with their presence in the stag-hunting
season, grumble unceasingly at the sport.
The country, Master, hounds, and hunt servants,
all come in for scathing criticism. One has a
great longing to let them try and hunt a deer
themselves, to convince them that it is not such
A B C work as they seem to think. Also, should
the Master persist in remaining in a covert to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hunt the big deer he knows to be there, instead
of laying on to the four-year-old which has just
broken away over a tempting line on the forest,
there is a chorus of discontented ones, "Oh, what
rot this is; why can't he go after a decent deer?"
The malcontents, either forgetting or not knowing
that it is the fat old sinner now doing his
utmost to save his skin by turning out his younger
relations, which gorges himself nightly on the
farmer's best turnips and corn, and that it will be
a poor consolation to the latter if hounds pursue
a young deer twenty odd miles and then lose him,
while the author of the mischief is left, possibly
with a keener appetite than ever, after his unwonted
exertions.</p>

<p>There is always a hope that a big fat stag may
be run up and killed, should his whereabouts be
a certainty, in time to lay on to another, and I
have often seen two deer killed in one day. A
fat stag which is merely blown and not exhausted,
will waste a lot of valuable time beating up and
down the water, too out of breath to breast the
hill and give a gallop, and too strong to be pulled
down. This gentleman is a most unpleasant
customer to tackle, as in fact is any deer at bay.
A stag is a grand looking beast when he stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with his back against a rock, in one of the picturesque
streams that abound on Exmoor, with
his lovely head well up, and great, sad, frightened
eyes, the pack baying round him and not daring
to come within striking distance of those death-dealing
horns. The sooner then the huntsman,
or one of the willing farmers always at hand and
ready to assist, can slip behind the beast and lasso
him, the better for everyone.</p>

<p>The head and slots of stags are the Master's
perquisite, the skin and inside and the hinds'
heads belong to the huntsman, who generally
shares the liver with the farmers. The carcase
is distributed amongst the farmers on whose land
the deer was found, and who highly appreciate a
bit of venison. The Master alone never gets
any, and to speak for myself I have only tasted
hunted stag once. This was when my mother
was sent, by a kind neighbour, a haunch of a
five-year old deer, which had given us a run of
nearly thirty miles, and very excellent it was. I
have never seen a more vicious stag either than
this one, for though he had run from Cloutsham
to within five miles of my mother's home,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he
fought desperately and severely injured two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
hounds before he was taken. I always remember
that gallop too on account of the marvellous way
the puppies worked, with hardly any old hounds
to help them, my father<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> having saved the older
hounds for the next day, when he was meeting in
a close woodland country, where he thought the
inevitable crowded field would work less havoc
among the older and more sensible hounds than on
the puppies, many of which were hardly way-wise.</p>

<p>There is one delusion that strangers labour
under who meditate a few days with the Devon
and Somerset Staghounds, and this is, that it is
absolutely necessary to ride "the horse of the
country," as they term it. I think this is quite
a mistake. Any horse that looks where he is
going, and doesn't go yawing about with his
head in the air, will go well on Exmoor, at any
rate after a time or two, but horses accustomed
to the country certainly get less frightened in soft
ground than strangers. In fact, a moor-bred animal
wont go into a bog at all. I have ridden all sorts
and conditions of horses, and I think I would
choose animals that stand about 15.1 or 15.2.,
short-legged and strong backed and with good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
shoulders, for though I have seen a little straight-shouldered
Exmoor pony canter down a hill
without a false step, when most people have
been leading down it, yet I never think it gives
you a comfortable sensation to be sitting almost
on your horse's ears. Two things are absolute
necessities, blood and condition, without these
one cannot hope to get to the end of a long
moorland gallop with comfort to either man or
beast. I know no more hopeless-looking objects
than a poor underbred and underfed hireling,
floundering through the wet ground, remorselessly
urged on by an ambitious but ignorant
tripper, whose pedigree will probably bear even
less looking into than his unfortunate steed's.
For a very light weight with extravagant ideas,
polo ponies would be ideal mounts, being in the
height of condition, after the close of the season
at Hurlingham, and very fast and handy on their
legs, but it is not everyone who can afford or
would care to risk valuable animals on such
broken ground. Some people hold that big
horses are better than small ones, but I cannot
say I agree with them. A large horse shakes
himself and his rider to pieces galloping down
the hills, and if you would see a long run well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
you must gallop down hills, and take it easy up
them; he also does not recover himself so
quickly should he make a mistake over the
rough ground, and is more liable to strains and
over-reaches in the boggy land, to say nothing
of the fact that he can frighten you to death in
the tiny narrow paths through the woods, where
a false step means rolling into the river many
feet below. A small horse <i>may</i> be quite as dangerous,
but I don't think he feels so clumsy, and
again, a small horse undoubtedly comes to time
again sooner after a hard day. One thing I
specially dislike on the moor, and that is a hard
puller. People say, "what does it matter, when
there's heaps of room." This is all very well on a
racecourse, but when you are on the verge of
almost a precipice intersected with ruts, peat holes
and other trifles, with either a bog or a river waiting
for you at the bottom, it is very poor fun to be
hardly able to steady your horse, much less hold
him, and I have seen some very nasty falls resulting
from the inability of an unhappy sportsman
to control his mount.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 567px;">
<img src="images/illus-107.jpg" width="567" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>PRINCESS, IRISH MARE.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Property of Mrs. Lewis Mackenzie.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>You can also have a nasty fall if you try and
descend the steep combes sideways. It is a
golden rule to ride a horse straight down. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a><br /><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the worst then he can but sit down, but if you
are half cantering, half shambling down a hill
sideways, and your mount puts a foot wrong, a
horrible fall is the probable result. It is a wonder
to me, looking at the crowd of people riding,
most of them ignorant of the first principles of
horsemanship, why there are not more bad falls
than there are on Exmoor. Now and then it is
true a man gets his face cut, or a rib broken or
something of that sort, but really bad accidents
are most rare. I suppose that the sweet little
cherub that sits up aloft, looks after the welfare
of the bold tripper, or perhaps the softness of the
ground has more to do with it.</p>

<p>I think Exford is the best centre for stag-hunting,
that is if you do not mind having absolutely
nothing to do on the off days, or have
enough horses to go out with the foxhounds or
harriers. Some people like Minehead, others
prefer Dulverton. Personally I prefer Porlock,
as it is quite close to the Moor meets, and is far
and away the prettiest place to stop in. Accommodation
is good and moderate, hirelings are to
be obtained there and at Minehead, and are
generally very good animals, though I would
advise anyone with a couple or more well-bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
horses in condition, to bring them down. The
difference in comfort, especially in the long distances
hacking home, is great.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken of saddles for
this work, for there is no country where horses
suffer so terribly from sore backs as Exmoor.
The steep climbs up and down hill, the great
heat, followed by standing still till a horse is
chilled, then another gallop perhaps, and lastly a
long ride home, horse and man, or oftener
woman, dead beat, work absolute havoc in
a stable full of otherwise sound horses. I would
advise anyone hunting with the staghounds to
have all saddles thoroughly fitted, if possible one
for each horse, the horses' backs hardened a little,
and above all to see that the saddle is left on the
horse for some time after he is cool, whenever
he comes in from hunting. Very few persons
will take the trouble to do this, especially when
a horse comes home about eleven o'clock at night,
but it should always be insisted on.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September is to my mind
the pleasantest time on Exmoor, and from the
middle of the month to the time stag-hunting
ends, about the tenth of October, sport is generally
far better than earlier in the season. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
deer break covert quicker, and run better, the
weather is cooler, and Cloutsham which has
in the earlier part of the season, been the happy
picnic ground, to crowds of delighted strangers,
now affords a sure find of a good Stag. This
is, thanks to its kind owner and his son, who
though not hunting-men themselves, are most
desirous of showing sport to others. So much
has been said about this opening function at
Cloutsham and the beauty of the surrounding
scenery, which in fact cannot be over-rated, that
I will not allude to the "vast leafy combes," the
"hazy outline of the Welsh coast," and the
"stately purple-clad hill of Dunkerry," except
to warn those who have never tried to gallop
over the said Dunkerry that it is the most
deceptive bit of going to my mind in the
whole of the stag-hunting country. It is covered
with rocks and stones, alternating with bogs,
and is generally productive of a lame horse.
I never saw it look so lovely as one day during
hind-hunting.</p>

<p>It was a soft muggy day in November, and I
was standing in a field behind Cloutsham farm,
when a hind went away over Dunkerry. As I
was riding a pony, I stood still and watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
proceedings. Anthony laid on, and the whole
hunt swept away up the hill, and as they did so
down came the fog like a curtain, but only covering
half the hill. By and bye, back came the
hind, and ran into Sweet Tree, as the extension
of Cloutsham Wood on the Exford Road is called,
and the hounds, huntsman and field all came one
by one out of the mist. It was like a ghost hunt.
Twice did that hind do the same thing, and then
sent a young sister to take her place, but hounds
were luckily stopped and the wily lady was captured,
after a great deal of twisting and doubling
up and down the water.</p>

<p>Very few people have any idea of the different
aspect the country wears in the hind hunting
season to what it does in stag-hunting time. In
August on your way to the meet, you pass dozens
of people, walking, riding, or driving, the latter
with huge luncheon hampers, which are most
welcome later on. The meet may be at Culbone
Stables, in which case the Lynton road outside
Lord Lovelace's plantation will be packed with
carriages, etc., and people will idle about and
stand in groups among the stunted fir trees, looking
out on a calm blue sea. The stag may after
some time "go to moor," and then away go the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
field after him, but for hours there will be carriages
on the Lynton Road on the chance he may
turn back and go to sea, which he may very
likely do. In this case, those of the riders who
have had enough, will turn round at the top of
the hill and go home, but the majority will ride
down through the Ashley Combe woods to the
sea, and wait in the warm August afternoon till
the stag is brought to land. The fishermen from
Porlock Weir are always on the look out on a
hunting day for a possible windfall in the shape
of a deer going to sea, which means a sovereign
in their pockets. The field meanwhile refresh
themselves and their horses at the picturesque
little hotel, the Anchor, and after the last rites of
the chase have been gone through, ride home in
the cool of the evening.</p>

<p>In hind hunting on a bitter December day, we
have a very different picture. About four shivering
women, or perhaps fewer, half a dozen sporting
farmers, the Master and the hunt servants
form the field. The women generally make a
bolt for the little cottage at Culbone Stables, and
sit round the fire there till Anthony comes for the
pack. The wind is blowing half a gale, and sleet
is falling, but once we are started no one cares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for the weather. Deer, unlike foxes, will run in
the teeth of the fiercest gale, and sometimes one
is literally nearly blown out of the saddle. The
hind which has probably left her calf lying in her
bed, will run a big ring out to the Deer Park
and back. With the ground at its heaviest, the
small field has to gallop its fastest to keep the
flying pack in sight. Back into Culbone the
hind comes, and we stop and listen, and wonder
if she will go to sea, trying in the meantime to
get a little shelter from the icy wind under the
larch trees. But our friend has not had half
enough yet, and may take us over the same ground
again, if she fails to induce another deer to take
her place, or possibly we may go away after a
fresh hind without knowing it; heart-rending
work this for horses and hounds. Ultimately she
will go to sea, either down the steep cliffs of
Glenthorne, or from Porlock Weir, and the boatmen
have to follow her, supposing it is not too
rough for their safety, while the field, by this
time of still smaller dimensions, wait patiently
for the end. Then home we go. Porlock Weir
was comparatively sheltered, but once on top of
the hill again, the gale seems to have increased,
and the sleet to be thicker, and by the time we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>get home we are nearly frozen, and it is pitch
dark. Yet to my mind notwithstanding the horrible
weather, hind hunting is a finer, wilder
sport than stag-hunting, and a run after a straight-going
hind in the spring when the weather is
better, is hard to beat. Fog is the great enemy
to hunting in the winter. Often the hounds
have to go home from the meet, after waiting a
couple of hours and more for it to lift.</p>

</div>

<p>I do not think casual visitors have any idea of
the immense strain on hounds, horses and men
that hunting from July to April entails, or they
would not grumble as much as they do when they
get a poor day's sport. Rather let them follow
the example of one most genial tripper, who when
a friend of mine remarked we had had a shocking
bad day, nothing but wood work, said: "Well,
I 'ear folks say they 'aven't 'ad a gallop, but I
always 'as a gallop, and what I do is this. I watch
one of them 'scarlet bounders' (presumably the
huntsman), and when he lays on to the stag, I
don't care where 'e is, I lays on to 'im. It takes
a bit of doing too, and I <i>always</i> 'as a gallop!"
Whether the "scarlet bounder" was equally
pleased with a noisy follower, when he wanted
to catch the slightest sound in covert, is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
matter, but a jovial sportsman of this sort is far
more welcome to the West Country than those
people who go down and grumble at everything,
and generally depart with the donation of a few
shillings to the deer damage fund.</p>

<p>It is out of this fund the farmers are paid for
the harm done to their crops by the deer, and
richly they deserve some compensation, for without
their help stag-hunting on Exmoor would
soon be a thing of the past.</p>

<h3>THE TIVERTON STAGHOUNDS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/illus-119.jpg" width="590" height="370" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>SIR JOHN AMORY'S STAGHOUNDS.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Though when Mr. Fenwick Bisset undertook
to revive Stag-hunting on Exmoor in 1855, the
attempt was regarded almost as a forlorn hope.
It has now been found necessary to start a second
pack in Devon, in order to keep down the herds
of red deer. The last established pack is a
private one belonging to Sir John Heathcoat
Amory, and its popularity with all classes of the
sport-loving West country is very great. Mr.
Ian Amory hunts the hounds himself, and he is
assisted by the Messrs. Las Casas, who act as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a><br /><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>whippers-in, the important duties of the harbourer
being also performed by an amateur.
Everything in this establishment is carried out
in the most sportsmanlike manner, and the time-honoured
traditions of the hunt of the wild red
deer are strictly adhered to. The sport shown
by this pack, since its institution in 1897, has
been excellent, and to the sportswoman who
dares not brave the storm-swept expanse of Exmoor
during the winter months, and yet loves
to share in the grand sport of hind-hunting, the
less exposed country hunted over by Sir John
Amory's staghounds offers very great advantages.
The picturesque little town on the Exe, indeed,
is likely to take a high place among Western
sporting centres, for it offers the triple attraction
of the pursuit of the stag, the fox and the hare
in its immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all forms of the chase, that of the
carted deer, has the unenviable distinction
of having been followed, discussed
and written about, by a greater
number of people ignorant of the first elements
of sport, than any other. It has too the disadvantage
of being scorned by some of the boldest
followers of the fox and the red deer, and thus
while "crabbed" by those incompetent to judge,
it is a "thing of naught" in the hunting calendar
of some of the best sportsmen and women of
the day. In spite of this, however, the hunt
of the carted deer is the source of pleasure and
health to many who otherwise would seldom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
never be seen in the hunting-field, and as such it
deserves to be chronicled.</p>

<p>That certain objections have always been urged
with more or less weight against this particular
form of sport, I am well aware, but I will leave
its defence to abler hands than mine, and while
ready to give help, if it may be, to any sister-sportswoman
who would take it up, I must say
boldly that a day with fox or hare is in my
opinion, worth more than a dozen brilliant
gallops after an enlarged deer. On the score of
humanity, however, there is undoubtedly nothing
to be said in its disfavour. The deer is well fed and
cared for, and rarely comes to harm when before
the hounds, and though there are nervous deer as
nervous people, who will in the one case "funk"
a possible fence, and in the other show signs of
extreme fear at the pursuit of hounds, I do not
believe in the agonies of terror of which the so-called
humanitarians are pleased to make so
much. On this point, however, let those who
like Lord Ribblesdale, can wield the pen with as
skilful a hand as they can steer a horse across
country, speak with the authority which is theirs
by right of profound knowledge, and long and
unusual experience. And if we should find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
other forms of sport are for whatever reason out
of our reach, we may well be content to ride
after the carted deer with such sisters of the
chase as Lady Julia Follett, Lady Georgiana
Curzon, Lady Downshire, and the brilliant
horsewomen who week after week are among
the followers of the Wards over the stiffest part
of the Meath country. Can we go far wrong
either in following such sportsmen as Lord
Coventry and Lord Ribblesdale, with the spirit
of Whyte-Melville inspiring us?</p>

<p>Let us then turn for a few words about the quarry
of the Stag-hunt. The animal pursued, whether
it be Stag, Havier, or Hind, has been carefully
selected and most heedfully cared for, so that
when it comes out for a gallop it is in the very
height of condition. It is not often that it is
asked to exert itself, for it comes out only in its
proper turn, and this in the larger hunting
establishments would not be more than three or
four times in the course of the season. A Stag,
fed on the choicest oats and the best old hay is
not easily fatigued, and probably at the close of
the day's proceedings, will not be nearly so
"done" as the horses that have ridden in its
pursuit, or the men and women to whom it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
been giving pleasure. We all know the old
history of Mr. Henry Nevill's deer, which lived
on terms of perfect amity with the hounds kept
for their chase, and I have myself seen a stag
deliberately trot down a road and look over the
hedge at the pack, which had considerately been
stopped till his Lordship should get his second
wind. The exploits of a celebrated old hind too,
which was on the best of terms with all connected
with her hunt, are still remembered in
the country in which she afforded sport. As
soon as she was released she would speed away,
often for twenty miles or so, and when weary
would take refuge in a wood. Recognising the
sign that the hunt was at an end, the huntsman
then stopped his hounds, leaving the hind in
peace till the deer-cart came up. When this
had been backed to the boundary fence of the
covert where the deer was waiting, and the old
driver had given a low peculiar whistle, the
keen ears and soft eyes of the hind would appear
through the bushes. If no enemy was in sight,
she would then jump lightly in the cart and be
driven home. Let us hope she would have a
more comfortable journey than many a sportswoman,
with weary limbs and a weary horse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
carry her, and many long miles stretching
between her and her abode.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 633px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>IN THE AIR. NO. 1.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>There are certain women who ride hard, for
whom this form of the chase has special advantages.
For example there is the woman who
from whatever cause, whether from the care of a
large household, or the pressure of the duties
that her literary or artistic, or it may be her
political tastes, have involved her in, finds it
extremely difficult to take a whole long day for
her pleasure in the field, and to such an one the
short day with staghounds will be an inestimable
boon. Again there are women, whose social or
domestic duties keep them in town during the
winter months, and to them a run with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
staghounds will be a much-prized form of recreation.</p>

<p>On the other hand it should be remembered
that to some women who are more or less of
invalids, and who would yet rather not go out at all
than leave off before the run is over, the possible
long day, and the almost certain fast pace with
staghounds, will be against this form of sport.
This, like most other matters connected with
sport, will depend very much whether the chase
of the deer is <i>the</i> sport of the neighbourhood,
when hounds will often make long days, or
whether, as in some good foxhunting countries,
it is more or less subservient to the chase of the fox.</p>

<p>There are others again whose lot is cast in a
good stag-hunting country, who honestly find a
satisfying enjoyment in riding after the hounds.
These will like to make long days, and if they
follow the chase to the end, will be not less
weary than their foxhunting sisters, by the time
they turn their steps homewards.</p>

<p>Let us see how such will fare.</p>

<p>Suppose that a run with Lord Rothschild's
splendid pack is in prospect, and that the meet
is fixed for twelve o'clock. If time is of moment
to you, you may reckon that if you arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
at the rendezvous three quarters of an hour later,
you will find you still have a margin before
hounds are laid on. This will give you a comfortable
morning's work, before the cart is at the
door. For remember, that a pony cart or dog
cart, or the more luxurious brougham, is very
necessary to the comfort of the hunter of the
carted deer. In the first place the long distances
covered and the fast pace, make large demands on
a woman's powers and those of her horse, and
she should, therefore, husband both till the moment
of the chase arrives. Equally for both
horse and rider too, she should, if possible, make
the return journey also in the cart.</p>

<p>That this often will not be practicable, and
for the same reason that it is generally useless to
have a second horse out stagging, does not in
any way detract from the comfort of having the
cart at hand if it can be managed. If, however,
the deer should run too fast and too far, for his
cart to come up to him for many hours after the
"take," then&mdash;and this will be the most frequent
experience of the followers of the chase&mdash;the
rail may prove the best hack home for both
woman and horse.</p>

<p>The former will thus be saved a weary jog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
home, and her horse will also be spared what,
even if he is a good hack, will be the most difficult
part of the day's work to him. And though,
of course, an ideal woman's hunter should also
be a perfect hack, how few even good horses
answer the description. What hunting woman
cannot recall some animal, and many it may be,
which have served their turn, for which she
would not have taken centuries, if offered when
he was sailing with magnificent action over a
grass country, but which on the journey home at
night, she would have been almost inclined to
give away to the first comer? But even with a
good hack, it is a doubtful pleasure to ride him
after he has tired himself in the chase, and you
will find it a relief unspeakable to exchange the
saddle for the cushions, and to drive or train
home, instead of striving to keep your weary
hunter on his legs.</p>

<p>But to return to the meet. When you get to
the place of meeting there will be three courses
open to you as a rule. You can either see the
stag un-carted and the hounds laid on, or you can
omit the first ceremony and come on the scene
with the hounds, which in well regulated establishments
will not have been allowed to catch a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a><br /><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a><br /><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>view of the cart, or you can adopt another
course, and wait till the stag has completed his
first circle, which he is almost sure to run before
leaving. If you incline to the last, and there is
much to be said in its favour, you will look out
for some point, such as the crossing of a road by
the stag, and trotting quietly down to it, you
will wait for the hounds to come up. By the
time they reach you, they will have got over the
first flurry with which staghounds always make
for the line, and will come chiming down as
prettily as a pack of harriers.</p>

<p>[I think the best plan is to come into the field
with the hounds, if possible, pick your own place
at the first fence&mdash;of course riding wide of the
hounds&mdash;and do your level best to get a good
start. If staghounds really run, a good start is
every bit as important with them as in the
Shires, and that is one reason I think they are
such good training for judgment, decision and
nerve. She who hesitates is sure to be lost
sooner or later, and when you have been out of a
good thing two or three times, because you did
not push along at first, it does make you keen.&mdash;C.F.C.C.]</p>

<p>Then you should ride to the hounds and watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
them working. You will observe that they
string more than foxhounds&mdash;though they are
foxhounds in everything but the use to which
they are put&mdash;but such packs as Lord Rothschild's
or the Queen's, will drive forward on a
hot scent and work out a cold one, in a way that
will delight any lover of hound work. Now
you may, nay you <i>must</i>, ride somewhat closer to
the pack than would be quite orthodox with
foxhounds, and if there should be anything like
a scent you will find that in spite of being a
light weight, it may be, and riding one of the
best, it will take you all your time to live with
them. Nor will you be in any danger of overriding
hounds. With a good deer you will find
you need all your judgment, horsemanship, coolness
and pluck to live to the end.</p>

<p>After you have been going some twenty or
twenty-five minutes, perhaps, hounds will run
up to their deer. But the sport will not be over.
If possible at this point you should notice whether
the deer has his mouth open or shut, for this
will tell you whether you may still look for a
long gallop or not. A deer, be it remembered,
closes his mouth when he is beaten, but as long
as he has it open, you may be sure he has not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
smallest intention of being captured. You will
find that with the consideration for the feelings
of the quarry which marks all the proceedings,
hounds will not be allowed to go on till ample
time has been given for the deer to get a good
start. He may not unlikely be encouraged by
the friendly crack of a hunting crop by one of
the field, but otherwise his Lordship will be left
to himself, and the hounds meanwhile will stand
with their sterns waving in eager impatience to
be off, and their eyes fixed on the face of the
huntsman. It was a grand sight to see poor Mark
Howcutt at such a moment, in the vale of Aylesbury.
The loose thong of his whip, as he sat
motionless in front of hounds was enough to keep
them in check, and when he quietly gathered the
thong up, they knew the moment had come, and
casting themselves on the line, they would break
into a chorus of rejoicing, and race eagerly away.</p>

<p>It is not till you see the stag soil, that you may
begin to take things easily, for this is generally a
sign of the beginning of the end. It is, however
(and here I recall the words of Whyte Melville),
an act of courtesy to those who supply our sport,
to stay and see the deer taken before we leave.
If you are up at the end of a good gallop over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the Vale, you may be pretty sure you will be
able to hold your own wherever fortune may
lead you, even if the Quorn hounds should be
running their best from the Ashby Pastures, over
the Twyford Vale to Burrough Hill, or the Cottesmore
lady-pack be racing in front of you from
Ranksboro' Gorse to Woodwell Head.</p>

<p>As stag-hunting begins later in the day than
the pursuit of the fox, so does it leave off earlier,
and the sportswoman who shares in it will generally
find herself at home in time to get into a
comfortable tea-gown, and give what our neighbours
call "five o'clock" to her friends. There
will then be the chance of a rest before dinner,
and to those who are not over-strong, or who
have heavy social duties before them, I would
recommend the plan of a well-known rider to
hounds in Leicestershire, who goes quietly to bed
and gets perhaps a couple of hours sleep before her
maid rouses her to dress for dinner. As many
women undoubtedly suffer from the strain entailed
by the great demands on their strength during the
hunting season, the plan may help them to keep
both good looks and health, and will thus give
them a keener enjoyment in their favourite sport.</p>

<p>And now a word as to equipment, though this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
will be brief indeed, as what applies to the
follower of the fox applies in almost every particular
to her who rides after the stag. I would
only suggest in the latter case that the habit
worn should be plain, and that the distinctive
collar of any Foxhunt of which you may be a
member, is not quite in place when you are
following another form of sport. As to the
vexed question of the tall and the round hat, in
the hunting-field, some will declare in favour of
comfort as represented by the latter, while others
will prefer the undeniable smartness of the
ugliest product of modern civilization.</p>

<p>[My advice to everyone is to take a change in
a Gladstone, and leave it either at the Inn where
the meet is, or better still with the clothing and
horse-box, for it is a serious matter to get ducked
in a brook and then perhaps have a long train
journey home, without the possibility of dry
clothes. I say this feelingly, as this year after
the Stag in Kent, I fell at a brook about 2.15&mdash;my
watch stopped, so I know the hour&mdash;and
after finishing the run, I had to ride seven miles
to Paddock Wood, before training home. Of
course I ought to have died of pneumonia after
this, but happily was none the worse.&mdash;C.F.C.C.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The above note reminds me that if at any
time you should get a wetting, such as that
described above, and have no welcome change
at hand, you will in nine cases out of ten experience
no harm, if in train or cart you cover your
wet clothing with coat or rug, or even horse-cloth
should nothing else be available. Some
may think even a probable chill preferable to
the last suggestion, but <i>verbum sap</i>.</p>

<p>The canteen for a day with staghounds will
not require much thought, for between the late
breakfast and early tea, which generally are
possible, the demands of appetite will not be
great. However, as there will be no second
horseman to rely on, the sportswoman will do
well to carry with her a few biscuits and a little
cold essence of beef, or a slice of plum pudding,
and some port wine should she prefer it. (A
medical friend says there is nothing like Kola
Wine.)</p>

<p>But now, last, though of more importance
than all that has gone before, we come to the
question of the hunter. To leave out of count
for the moment, the points we should insist on
for all women's hunters, the first great requisite
for a horse that is to follow staghounds, is speed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
For remember that the fastest possible form of the
chase, is when a pack of large-sized foxhounds,
is in pursuit of a red deer hind, over a grass
country. A well-bred horse is essential, and
other things being equal, if clean thoroughbred,
so much the better.</p>

<p>[From my eleven years' experience of Stag-hunting,
I have come to the conclusion that the
most essential thing is that a hunter should be
well-seasoned. If you ride a young horse with
the stag, which would go perfectly well with
foxhounds, he will go off his feed and fall all to
pieces, even if you are lucky enough not to
strain or over-reach him. A horse ought in my
opinion to be quite seven years old, to take his
turn regularly once a week stagging.</p>

<p>I quite agree with what you say about breeding,
but for a woman the ideal horse for staghounds
must not only be temperate, but in every
way good-mannered. I suppose it is the rush at
starting, which of course suggests racing, that
excites them, but I know by experience that a
horse which is a comfortable mount for a woman
with Foxhounds or Harriers, may prove quite
unmanageable if taken with Staghounds. A hot
horse, too, even if you can ride it, takes so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
out of itself, that it cannot stand the long days,
and is sure to knock up. With the packs I know
in Surrey and Kent, a good timber jumper is
essential, and in Kent you also want a water
jumper&mdash;a rare combination.&mdash;C.F.C.C.]</p>

<p>A good fencer will be the best to carry you in
the Vale of Aylesbury or the Ashford Vale;
while if you go out with the Queen's, you will
need a stouter animal for their Beaconsfield country,
and indeed for most of the country of the
Royal Hunt. With the Wards in Ireland, you
will need the very best class of horse you will ride
with the Meath, and in all countries where the
chase of the carted deer is pursued, you will, in
my opinion, find size and scope important, as a
large horse will be going well within himself while
a smaller one is at a stretch. As however to every
rule there is an exception, so an undoubted authority
tells me, that an Arab pony standing only
14&middot;2, was well to the front in a good run after
stag one day this season (1897-8), and pounded
some gallant Dragoons over a six-barred gate.</p>

<p>Although the fences in most stag-hunting
countries are generally of a manageable size, yet
as you have to gallop at them, you should have
a bold free horse under you. One too which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his wits about him is perhaps, if that be possible,
even more valuable after stag than after fox or
hare, the pace necessitating the promptest decision
and the greatest possible judgment in making
the best of the unexpected, which is sure to happen,
even when you think you know every inch
of the country.</p>

<p>Stag-hunting then, we have seen, has its advantages,
and I am not sure that if your lot is cast
in a provincial country where the interest of
watching hounds track their fox over flinty hills,
from the depths of one thick covert to the recesses
of another, is seldom varied by a gallop,
you will not do well to take your place, at least
occasionally, with the followers of the local staghounds.
Of course, I am taking for granted that
you are, more or less, interested in the working
of hounds; but if you should be one of the hard-riding
brigade, who frankly acknowledge they
hunt to ride, then I should say that your best
place will <i>always</i> be with staghounds, for with
them you may reckon on the gallop which with
other hounds is, and always must be, a matter of
doubt. In most parts of the country you will
find some staghounds within reach, at least of
the "iron covert hack," and in Ireland the Wards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and the Rosscommon are unrivalled for speed and
incident in any land. It is only, though, the
youngest, and pluckiest, and best mounted of us
who can hope to live over the stiff Irish banks at
the pace at which the latter hounds go. A saddening
thought, but true, as many a good woman
has found to her cost.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>IN THE AIR. NO. 2.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>If your hunting lot should be cast within distance
of a stag-hound kennel, I would strongly
advise you to learn something about the hounds.
Your pleasure in the chase will be greater if you
can distinguish between the notes of a trusted
hound and those of a youngster which has not
proved his right to your confidence. My own
reception by kindly Fred Cox, when I made my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
first visit to Lord Rothschild's celebrated kennels,
I have always felt to be a reproach to my fellow-sportswomen
on this point. It was during a
frost in the early days of 1895, that I determined
to ask Cox to show me his beauties on the flags.
A telegram brought back a satisfactory reply, and
I duly presented myself at Cox's door. Mrs.
Cox, however, was doubtful about admitting me,
and told me her husband was engaged to show
the hounds to a visitor at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>"But I made an appointment for that hour,"
was my remark, and the astonishment with which
the old lady regarded me I shall never forget.</p>

<p>With uplifted hands she exclaimed, "Well, to
be sure ma'am, we thought you was a man!" and
it was some little time, I could see, before the old
huntsman himself decided that though I had the
misfortune to be a woman, I was not altogether
ignorant of what a good hound should be.</p>

<p>It will be a good thing when more women
who ride to hounds know sufficient of hound
work to be able to take an intelligent interest in
the performance of the pack in the field, for those
who can only enjoy a mad gallop know but little
of the inner joys of the hunting field.</p>

<h2><a name="HUNTERS" id="HUNTERS">HUNTERS.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-149.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> great question in buying horses
to carry us with hounds is, of course,
expense. If our purses are deep and
well-lined, then we can ensure being
well carried, provided of course we know
sufficiently what we want to be able to choose
aright. But even with two or three hundred
guinea hunters, we may, according to good
authority, only hope for the superlatively good
one, once in a lifetime. Yet if only once this
joy is to be ours it is worth trying for, the nearer
perfection is our horse the greater will our pleasure
and comfort be in the hunting field.</p>

<p>In saying this I am speaking of the great
majority of women, those, who while being
good riders and fair judges of what a horse
should be, are yet not among the exceptional few
who can make any horse go and most go well,
and who can, therefore, lay claim to the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
consummate horsewoman. That the latter is
rare, even in these days of hard riding, few will
be found to deny, though perhaps many of us
have a belief deep down in our minds, to which
we would not give utterance for worlds, that we
ourselves are above the average in our skill with,
and knowledge of, horseflesh.</p>

<p>So those who feel they have nothing to learn
will not be likely to trouble themselves with
these few words on the choice of hunters, and to
the "exceptional few" there is certainly nothing
to be said that they do not know far better than
one of their less-blessed sisters can tell them.
But with these reservations there may still be a
goodly proportion of riders to hounds, who will
like to consider the subject of what a hunter
should and should <i>not</i> be.</p>

<p>With a devout wish then that we could each
truly say we find our pleasure in any horse, because
even if he is a bad one, the excitement and
interest of checking his faults and getting the best
out of him, will make up for our loss of pride of
place, let us think for a moment of the points essential
for the average woman's hunter to possess.</p>

<p>These are, a well-laid shoulder, good carriage
of the head and neck, and good manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Many other qualities there are which are more
or less desirable, but the above are absolutely indispensable
to a woman's safety, as well as pleasure
in the hunting field, and, from choice, no
woman should buy a horse that does not possess
them.</p>

<p>A good shoulder, as we all know, means so
much to the comfort of every rider, whether
man or woman, that too much stress cannot be
laid on it. But if desirable for all, to a woman
it is the one point, for which, if she have to
choose, she will give up all else. Without a
shoulder which gives the play necessary for him
to recover himself, a horse with the dead weight
of a woman on his back, has no chance in the
case of a slip-up, or peck, or any of the thousand-and-one
trifles that will scarcely receive passing
notice, if he does put himself right and go on.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, some women who go
fairly hard in the wake of hounds, do not realise
how all-important a matter this is. They do
not, in fact, seem to understand the enormous
difference between the dead pressure of our
weight on a horse&mdash;light in comparison though
this be in reality&mdash;as we sit with our support
entirely on one side, to that of the man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
though in nine cases out of ten heavier than we
are, yet by the even distribution of pressure and
the springiness afforded by the double support
of the grip of his legs on both sides of the
animal, may be described as <i>living</i> weight. The
advantage given by a man's seat is, I believe,
incalculable, as those of us who have done long
distance rides in uncivilised parts of the world,
can say from practical experience, yet I would
not&mdash;even if it were of the smallest use, in the
face of popular opinion&mdash;advise women to start
a crusade against the existing state of things.
We have crusades enough in these days, without
taking up the war of the saddle, a victory in
which might turn out to be a disastrous failure
from other points of view.</p>

<p>That the head should be well put on, is again
of special importance to a woman, because beside
the fact that she has less physical power than
a man as a rule, from the nature of her seat she
has less control over her horse, one therefore that
carries his head badly, may prove beyond her
power altogether to control, and will certainly
be unpleasant and fatiguing to ride.</p>

<p>From the full clear eye which will look at you
with such winning intelligence, you may and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
indeed must, if the horse is a stranger to you,
make up your mind as to his character. And
this is a test that will never fail. I would, therefore,
counsel an intending buyer to turn resolutely
from any horse that does not satisfy her in
this respect, however good his points may otherwise
be.</p>

<p>This brings me to the subject of manners, and
full as much may be said on this important topic
when we discuss the equine species, as when our
talk concerns the human race, for is it not true,
and <i>equally</i> true, that "manners maketh" both
horse and rider what they are. But to confine
ourselves to the former for the present, and to
see first what he should <i>not</i> be. A horse that is
to give you pleasure in the hunting field should
not pull, and above all things must not rear, for
nothing is so likely to lead to a ghastly accident
as this. He must not be a refuser, as here a
woman's physical lack of power will be against
her. If he fidgets, you will find a long day
on his back most fatiguing, and should he be a
kicker your enjoyment will be marred. If, indeed,
you ride an animal with this fault, and one
which at the same time has any turn of speed,
you should try to get to the front and stay there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
for so you will have more space and freedom
than can otherwise be the case. Wherever you
are, remember you cannot be too careful to keep
the active heels out of reach of the hounds, and
of your companions in the field. It is most
desirable that a hunter should be quiet at gates,
and here, perhaps, I may be allowed to remark
that all women who ride to hounds should be
able to open a gate quietly and quickly, so if
you are not proficient in this, I should advise a
little practice by yourself. In a flying country
your horse should be more than ordinarily bold,
and as clever as you can get him for a creeping
country, for never forget that you cannot drive
or squeeze him as a man can. If you are a
thorough good horsewoman you may of course
use spurs, and thus force him "where he would
not," but to raise the whip as you near a fence is
to teach your horse to swerve, for he very soon
learns to expect and shrink from the blow. Beside
all these negative and positive qualities, the
perfect hunter must be a perfect hack <i>if possible</i>,
and when you have these combined you may
congratulate yourself on having the horse of a
lifetime.</p>

<p>A horse with the manners I have described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a><br /><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>will not be young, and I should say, though each
rider will have her own opinion about this, that
a horse is best for a good woman with hounds,
when he is seven off, or even over.</p>

<p>In height he may be about 16 to 16.1, and
when buying, remember that there is a certain
class of horse which looks much smaller than it
really is. This is the animal with a large body
on short legs, which has the large bone, the
good barrel, and the large knees and feet of one
that <i>stands</i> much higher.</p>

<p>Whether you have one of these, or an upstanding
creature which looks all, and perhaps,
more than he is, let him be as near thoroughbred
as you can afford to buy him. I think, myself,
as I have said, that old horses are on the whole
safer to ride than young ones, though of course
if anything does go wrong with them, they have
not the power of recovery that a younger one
has. A saying of that good judge Whyte Melville
is worth remembering. He was speaking
of the horses that would be at the end of a long
run, and said, "it will always be found that one
or more of these is a thoroughbred, an old horse,
and under 15.2," and is ridden by a lightweight,
he might have added. At any rate our light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>weight
is one point in our favour, and another is
our light-hands. I am firmly of opinion that in the
matter of hands we distinctly score in comparison
with our husbands and brothers, who in so many
ways have the best of it in the saddle. For
every man who possesses the coveted "hands,"
you will find half-a-dozen women who have
them. We are too, quicker as a rule, to grasp a
situation, or to anticipate an impending fall, and
indeed, if we were not, we should rarely have
time to free ourselves and get clear of our horse,
for unless we are <i>ready</i> when the time comes we
have no chance of escape, as those have who can
save themselves on either side, when they feel
their horses going.</p>

</div>

<p>It is difficult to say what price you would have
to give for animals such as these, but any coming
with a good character from a known stable,
would probably cost from &pound;150 to &pound;300, and <i>if
you can afford it</i> the money would be well spent.
With two good all-round horses, such as I have
attempted to describe, a woman would see more
sport than with three or four inferior ones to
carry her. They will come out sooner than less
well-bred ones, and by good management and
having both out with hounds, their owner should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a><br /><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>be able to get two days a week with them.
Wherever possible I should always advise women
to have out two horses, for this plan not only
economises horse flesh, but is an immense saving
of fatigue to them, as nothing is more tiring than
to ride a weary horse. An intelligent groom
should know how to pick up hounds in the middle
of the day, if they should be anywhere near home,
and though in the case of a great run this would
be out of the question, then the enjoyment of the
long gallop will have to make up to them for the
days when the horse will not be able to come
out.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as many of us know by mournful
experience that we cannot afford to buy the best
in the way of horse flesh, let us consider what we
can forego without risk to life or limb.</p>

<p>1. We may dispense with size, because if a
light weight, we can ride horses that would not
carry the average man. This at once lessens the
price, as the demand is of course much smaller,
and for &pound;60 or &pound;80, or even less, you might
meet with a serviceable and pleasant mount. Of
course to the few women who weigh as much or
more than a man this cannot apply, and indeed,
for such I may say frankly that I know of no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in which they can mount themselves with safety,
except by buying the best horses that money can
procure.</p>

<p>2. The second way in which, if we must cut
down our prices, we can do so fairly safely, is in
having less of strength behind the saddle. Not
that I would advise a horse with weak quarters
under any circumstances, but while the qualifications
in front of the saddle of which I have spoken
are indispensable, I believe, if we do not ride over
eleven stone, we may make some sacrifice in the
matter of power behind the saddle. Those
horses which are too light behind to carry heavy
weights with safety are often very pleasant to ride,
and we may meet with them at a very reasonable
price.</p>

<p>3. Again, if we wish to keep within a moderate
figure in the purchase of our hunters, we need
not reject those that are undeniably slack in the
couplings and have short back ribs, and consequently
give the impression of being very long
in the back, always of course supposing that they
are suitable in other respects. Such horses are
often pleasant enough to ride, and as they could
in no case be suitable for a heavy weight, they
should never be high priced. The great draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a><br /><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>back
to having such, of course, is that they will
not come out so often, or stand so long a day as
a truer shaped horse will.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>SKYSCRAPER.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Grandson of Hermit In Alarm.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Property of Lady Gerard.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>A counsel of perfection is to have a saddle for
every horse in your stable. This is so important
that though it involves a considerable outlay with
every change in your horses, it will be found a
real economy in the end. When your saddles
are overhauled, as they should be at the beginning
of the hunting season, every horse should have a
saddle fitted to it, and thus, and thus only, will
you&mdash;provided of course your stable management
is what it should be&mdash;escape the sore backs which
will entail loss of sport in a way that is peculiarly
aggravating, when you know it might have been
avoided.</p>

<p>As important and yet within the reach of
everyone is for every horse to have its own bridle.
Never allow any departure from this rule, and see
yourself that the head piece of each horse fits
easily and that the throat lash is loose, also (and
this is a point on which few grooms are to be
trusted) that the bit has been properly fitted to
rest on the right part of the mouth. This is of
no slight importance, for a badly fitting bridle
will spoil the manners of the very best of horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>I should advise a woman always to ride with a
double bridle, for with a snaffle her strength, as
a rule, will not be sufficient to hold the horse
together when he is tired. With light-mouthed
horses, either a leather curb or a curb chain sewn
in leather will be found the best. A good hint
given by an experienced horseman is to drop the
snaffle and ride lightly on the curb when going
home after a long day, as this by relieving the
horse will be less tiring to his rider. Another
thing to remember is, that while in the morning
when hacking to the meet you will naturally
choose the soft sidings of the roads, on returning
at night you should keep your horse on the crown
of the road, as this will be easier going for him
and he will be less liable to stumble.</p>

<p>As samples of high-class hunters that have been
ridden well up to hounds in different countries, I
would point to the horses reproduced in these
pages, and the choice between the speedy thoroughbred
and the clever Irish or provincial horse, must
be dictated by the form of the chase and the
country over which he is to carry you, and by
the depth of purse to be reckoned with in the
purchase.</p>

<h2><a name="OTTER-HUNTING" id="OTTER-HUNTING">OTTER-HUNTING.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-171.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Possibly</span> no form of sport has
grown into favour more than Otter-hunting
of late years. Fresh hunts
are continually springing into existence,
and there are now in the United Kingdom
some eighteen recognised packs of
Otterhounds. In speaking of a pack of
"Otterhounds" one does not necessarily
imply that the pack are Otterhounds by
breed, as Foxhounds, both Welsh and English,
are frequently pressed into the service
of Hunting the Otter, most, if not all packs
of Otterhounds having some Foxhounds
among them. Besides these, many half-bred
hounds are used, that is a cross between
Otterhound and Foxhound.</p>

<p>In fact for all round work the latter are often
preferred, as the cross-bred hounds possess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
stamina, constitution, high courage and dash of
the Foxhound, together with the deep, musical
note, heavy coat, and grand appearance of the
Otterhound.</p>

<p>Some packs of Otterhounds indeed are composed
entirely of Foxhounds entered to otters,
and so keen do hounds get on the scent of the
Otter, that Foxhounds will become perfectly
steady from hunting a fox, though they may
have run two or three seasons with a pack of
foxhounds, as soon as they have become accustomed
to hunting their new quarry, and are
fairly entered to the Otter.</p>

<p>The true Otterhound is a large upstanding
hound with hard shaggy coat, long ears with the
"roll" in them similar to that of the Bloodhound.
In colour, more of them are whole-coloured
than Foxhounds, the commonest colour
being black with tan points, though they are also
sometimes red, and black and white. The Otterhound
has a beautiful, deep melodious note,
which he uses freely when hunting, in fact one
of his faults is that he is apt to throw his tongue
sometimes too freely and to be "noisy."</p>

<p>For real sport, as a general rule, a mixed pack
is to be preferred <i>i.e.</i>, one composed of Otter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>hounds,
half-bred Hounds, and Foxhounds.
They must be in the best condition, have good
sound, hard feet to stand a long tramp along the
road to the meet, perhaps several hours swimming
in very cold water, and then the long
walk&mdash;sometimes fifteen or twenty miles&mdash;back
to their kennels at night.</p>

<p>The management of the Hounds in kennel is
exactly like that of Foxhounds. They should be
regularly fed and exercised in exactly the same
manner as Foxhounds, the only difference being
that they can be kept "bigger" in condition, as
Otterhounds do not have to go fast, but have
often long, slow, tiring hunts, and have to stand
long exposure to cold water. In addition to the
hounds themselves, good terriers are indispensable.
These must be of good constitution, with
good feet and legs to stand the long journeys on
the road, and as hard as nails in every respect.</p>

<p>Otter-hunting is a sport that is followed on
foot and is therefore one that any woman, rich
or poor, possessed of a good pair of legs and a
thick pair of boots, can join in whenever the
meet is within reach.</p>

<p>Most packs have given up hunting at break of
day, and meet at the more reasonable hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
nine or ten. Having arrived at the meet, and
after a few minutes' law has been given for late
comers, the hounds will be put on to the river,
and the business of the day will begin. The
Huntsman will always, if he knows his business,
have some hounds on each side of the river, so
that not a holt or inch of the water may be
missed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 616px;">
<img src="images/illus-174.jpg" width="616" height="438" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>GROUP OF OTTER HOUNDS.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>We will suppose that the river is being
drawn up stream, for most huntsmen, for various
reasons too lengthy to go into here, prefer to
draw up stream. Perhaps several miles are
traversed and no sign of an otter. Suddenly one
of the old hounds is seen to hang and lash his
stern at a bend of the river, the rest of the pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
eagerly rush to him, and soon are busy trying
every stick and stone and tuft of grass an otter
may have touched during his nightly wanderings,
and though they cannot quite speak to it, there
are unmistakeable signs that an otter has been on
the river. The whole pack know it too, and
become doubly keen and swim backwards and
forwards across the river eagerly examining with
their trusty noses, every stone, island, or bit of
shingle where an otter may have touched. Every
now and again they come to some spit or bend
in the river where he has touched, and then
they can just "feather" to it, and one old hound
actually speaks, but it is only a stale line and the
rest of the pack can but just own it. A mile
higher up we come to a spot where a small
brook joins the river we are drawing, and in a
moment a change comes over the scene. Across
a bend at the mouth of the brook every hound
dashes forward on a hot drag, a cheer from the
Master&mdash;who is his own huntsman&mdash;a touch on
his horn, and away the whole pack of eighteen
couples dart up the rocky dingle, and with a
musical chorus make the wooded valley ring
again.</p>

<p>Here is a burning scent, and the ground being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
rough they get clean away from the most of the
field for nearly two miles, but at length they
check on an old weiring made of wattle work
and covered with big stones. One by one the
old hounds leave this, and with a satisfied shake
plainly say they know their otter is not there.
No doubt a place where he has been lying the
day before, but now he has moved on to fresh
quarters. The master makes a dash up stream to
make quite sure his otter is not above him, then
a return is made to the main river, by the nearest
route. And now as we are quite sure the otter
is not below us we have every hope of a find.
We soon strike the drag again, but here there is
more water, and consequently it is only across
certain bends or spots where the otter has landed,
that hounds can speak to his line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus-177.jpg" width="550" height="434" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>OTTER HOUND AND TERRIER</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>For nearly three miles they pick out his line
up stream, trying every hole and corner and tree
stump where an otter might possibly lie, till at
length we come to a long deep pool half-a-mile
in length, and shaded by many overhanging trees.
At the head of this is an old ash tree, with roots
spreading down to the water's edge. Hounds
seem to wind it before they get within twenty
yards of the spot, and with a dash and cry they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
rush at it, and begin baying and tearing the roots
with tooth and claw. Excitement is now at its
height. "Look out below!" shouts the master,
and the first and second whippers-in make their
best pace to the fords above and below, accompanied
by willing members of the hunt, all
anxious to help in the day's sport, whilst others
put themselves in likely spots to get a view if
the otter should but show his nose above water,
or betray his whereabouts by the long line of
bubbles called "his chains." The hounds dart
a little way down stream to make sure that our
quarry has not slipped away from the belt, but
they can make nothing of it and seem loath to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
leave the old ash tree, most of the old hounds
persisting in returning to it. At last, after some
difficulty, an entrance is made for one of the
terriers, and after a short scuffle inside, a line of
silvery bubbles darts out from the belt. Another
minute and a ringing "Tally-ho" comes from
down stream, and away swim the hounds, every
one in the pack speaking to him. Now the
hunt begins in real earnest. For two long hours
they hunt him in this pool, marking him first in
one place, now in another, then they swim him
from one end to the other, and once he narrowly
escapes meeting his doom on the bank. Suddenly
he disappears, and nothing can be made of him
for some twenty minutes, till at last one of the
old hounds hits him off below the lower ford.
He has slipped by, unseen in the muddy water
and after going about a hundred yards or so down
stream, has taken to the land, through a thick
covert overhanging the river on the steep hillside.
Every hound is now throwing his tongue
wildly on the line and making the woodland
fairly rattle again with their music, they are close
behind him, after a couple of rings round the
big wood, and it seems as if he would never
reach the river, but the briars are very thick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the hounds have difficulty in getting through,
and he just manages to reach the water as one
hound makes a grab at him. Hounds, otter and
one of the field all come tumbling down into
the water together. We are now in a deep pool
half-a-mile lower down the river, but there is
little or no cover here and he gets no rest. There
is a capital scent on the water too, and hounds
never give him a moment's peace. He is constantly
viewed and is getting dead beat. At last
he makes an attempt to get over the lower ford.
But the hounds are too close to him, and with a
dash they are on him. Woo-whoop, and another
dog-otter is added to the tale of the slain after a
capital hunt of three-hours-and-a-half. With
considerable difficulty he is taken from the
hounds, his head, tail, and pads are distributed to
the field and the hounds receive their well-earned
blood.</p>

<p>To those women who can enjoy healthy exercise,
good sport, and can appreciate beautiful
hound-work amidst lovely surroundings, and at a
time of year when they can get no other kind of
hunting, my advice is "come otter hunting."
Having once come out, you will assuredly want
to come again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The season for otter hunting commences as
soon as the water is warm enough, that is in
March or April, and goes on till about the end
of September. Of course May, June, July and
August are the best months, as to hunt big rivers
they must be low and the weather warm, to enable
hounds and men to stand many hours of
water work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 626px;">
<img src="images/illus-180.jpg" width="626" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>END OF THE SEASON.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Looking back.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The late Lord Hill hunted an otter for ten
hours and eventually killed it. Hunts of five to
seven hours are of frequent occurrence, and often
end in the otter being left master of the situation.</p>

<p>One word of advice to those ladies who may
be going out for the first time. <i>Do not</i> in your
eagerness crowd on the hounds or get in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of them when drawing. <i>Do not</i> walk down the
river the hounds are going to draw, to find
them, instead of coming to the meet. <i>Do not</i>,
when an otter is found, rush wildly about, up
and down the bank in front of hounds swimming
their otter, in hope of seeing him. If you do,
you will be doing harm and spoiling the sport of
others as well as your own.</p>

<p>Remember that thick boots and a short skirt
are necessaries, if you wish to enjoy your day
with otter hounds.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">La Fontaine's</span> lines, to which I
have appended a somewhat free translation,
could certainly not be applied
to the modern representative of the
species, whose extensive educational
privileges on the subject of bait and
flies have formed his mind, brought
his acquirements thoroughly up to date, and
elevated him from an innocent unresisting
victim into an adversary whose cunning not
unfrequently out-matches our own, but of
whom the true fisherman should scorn to
take an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>This being a sport in which delicacy of hand is
more necessary than mere brute strength, it is especially
adapted to women who love fresh air and
beautiful scenery, and who are willing to bide the
good time at which the fish feel disposed to rise.</p>

<p>I should perhaps say here that my remarks are
intended to apply to salmon and trout fishing in
rivers and lakes, taking incidentally such "coarse
fish," pike, perch, etc., as are to be found by the
way.</p>

<p>Of all fish the salmon stands pre-eminent for
his sporting qualities, and next to him in order
come trout of all kinds.</p>

<p>Salmon are a curious and interesting race,
whose habits have been an object of study to the
naturalist for many years past. They are born
in the shallow reaches of rivers, the eggs taking
from eighty to over a hundred days to hatch, the
exact length of incubation being determined by
the temperature of the water, and they sometimes
remain in or near their original quarters till they
are from one to three years old, when they migrate
to the sea. By far the greater number,
however, descend to the sea within twelve to
fifteen months after they are hatched out from
the <i>ova</i>. Up to this crisis in their history they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
are called parr, and seldom exceed some three
ounces in weight. As the period of migration
approaches&mdash;usually in the spring, though autumn
migrations also occur&mdash;the samlets increase in
size; silvery scales replace their barred markings,
and they are known as smolts. Both parr and
smolts feed greedily in the rivers, but it is a
curious fact that subsequent to their first visit to
the sea none of the salmon tribe appear to feed
in fresh water, the stomach almost invariably
being empty when examined. They remain in
the sea for an uncertain period which may vary
from three or four months to as much as two
years, and during this time must certainly feed
with voracity, as they increase many pounds in
weight. On their first return to fresh water as
grilse they weigh from two to eight pounds.</p>

<p>I have myself seen, in the Killery Bay, a shoal
of salmon making for the mouth of the Erriff
river. They were apparently led by a large fish,
which from time to time sprang out of the water,
I suppose to reconnoitre the neighbourhood. The
fisherman used to look out for this leading fish,
and run a net round the shoal. Salmon certainly
do not live in company in the rivers, whatever
they may do in the sea. They start on the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
up stream in shoals, but soon separate to take
up their quarters in the different pools through
which they pass. They are now promoted to the
name of grilse, and attain the rank of salmon on
their second and all subsequent migrations. Their
arrival in fresh water is partly determined by
conditions of weather and water; also by the
special circumstances of the river to which they
belong, <i>i.e.</i>, whether it be early or late. The
fish come up in prime condition, for the purpose
of spawning, and return eventually emaciated and
most unattractive-looking, after this has been
accomplished. In the first state they are called
"clean" or "fresh-run" fish, and are a bright
silvery colour; in the second they are termed
"kelts," become reddish or dark in colour, and
from being thick and cobby in shape appear long
and eel-like, the males having developed strange
crooked snouts which vanish in quite a miraculous
way when they return to the sea. There is
no sign of this odd proboscis when they first enter
the river, so that it comes and goes, leaving no
token of its presence behind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Salmon are now unfit for the table, and must
be returned to the water uninjured, when they
are caught. I might here say, as I am regarding
the salmon from a culinary point of view,
that it greatly enhances the flavour and firmness
of a clean fish, if he is "crimped" at once
on being landed. He should first be killed by a
blow on the head, and then cut into slices about
an inch thick; taking out the joints of the backbone
and running a stout piece of cord through
the hole thus made. These slices may then be
put into the river where the current is not too
strong, the string being secured to the bank by a
stout peg, and they should remain in the water
for several hours until the flesh "rises," as it is
called, to the "crimp."</p>

<p>My appetite for crimped salmon received,
however, on one occasion a severe shock. I
caught a beautiful fish weighing about eight or
ten pounds, in the Hampshire Stour. The keeper
proceeded first to kill him, and then began the
crimping process. He advanced as far as the
shoulder, at which moment I told him to stop,
saying he might have the rest for himself.
Thanking me, he laid his portion on the ground
and we went further down the river. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>half-an-hour
we returned, and a friend who was with
me and who had studied medicine, took up the
head and shoulders of the fish and showed it me.
To my horror, the heart, which was plainly
visible and untouched by the cut of the knife,
was still beating strongly. My companion assured
me it was merely muscular action, but it was a
ghastly sight, and for a long time I could not
face crimped salmon again.</p>

<p>The instinct of the fish urges them to run up
the river as high as possible, sometimes at a
tremendous pace, and to make violent efforts to
leap all obstacles in their way.</p>

<p>When in this state of mind they very frequently
turn into small tributary streams, which, being
flooded, allow them to pass up, but where they
are sometimes found almost high and dry and
unable to return, like a stranded whale of small
proportions.</p>

<p>Sea trout also belong to the migratory species,
and of them it may be said, shortly, that they
are, in appearance much like miniature salmon,
and have game and fighting qualities of very
high order.</p>

<p>I may perhaps be allowed to say here that I
have found mackerel, caught in the sea with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
light trolling rod and trout tackle, give a great
deal of sport. They are particularly muscular
little fish, and the curl of their lithe tapering
bodies, and forked tails, seems to give them a
hold on the water which is out of all proportion
to their actual size. When caught, after they
have been killed, the large vein in the throat or
gills should be torn. They bleed to quite an extraordinary
extent, but are much better eating
and less oily when they have been treated thus.</p>

<p>Bull-trout are something between the salmon
and the sea-trout, and are also migratory fish of
much the same habits and characteristics. They
are very common in some rivers, less so in others,
but I remember seeing one caught in Dhulough,
County Mayo. There were also in this same
place numbers of sea-trout which rose to the fly
or came at a minnow, but as far as we could
learn there was no egress from the lake by which
these fish could get into the sea. They must,
however, have had some means of descent.</p>

<p>The Salmo Ferox, or Great Lake Trout grows
to an enormous size, weighing as much as thirty
pounds. They give quite as good sport as a salmon,
and many of them were caught some years
ago in Loch Arkaig. The method of fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was to troll for them in a boat, either with a fly
or with a small gudgeon or minnow, but always
with pretty fine tackle, heavily shotted so as to
sink to a considerable depth. I hear that none
have been taken in this way for a very long time
in that water.</p>

<p>There only remains to be mentioned the
ordinary brown trout of our streams and rivers,
so common and so delicious when in good condition,
but by far the most wary and difficult to
catch of all his tribe.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>The Cast for Salmon.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest initial mistakes made by
the novice in salmon-fishing is to continue flogging
the water for hours together, without intermission,
and regardless of the state of the sky or
water. It is very
difficult to give general
directions as to
the latter, for circumstances
vary in
different rivers, and experience only can enable
the angler to judge when the right moment has
come, but in floods or in rising water no fish
will, as a rule, pay the slightest attention to the
fly. As to the weather, a fresh breeze which
ripples the current of the river or the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the lake is always a point in the angler's favour,
and the sky should be overcast. A bright sun
is generally fatal to any chance of sport, but
there are of course exceptions to this rule. The
largest salmon I ever caught, and which weighed
thirty-two pounds, rose to a fly just before sunset,
after a cloudless day, during which he had
remained at rest close under the bank, holding a
<i>lev&eacute;e</i> of numerous visitors who came to admire
his fair proportions as he lay motionless and,
apparently, without fear, within a foot of the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>I have seen fish rise as if they were mad, in a
gale, with pelting rain and flashes of lightning.
In weather like this, my father caught in one
day some years ago, thirteen salmon and one
hundred-and-seventy sea trout to his own rod in
the Erriff. It was a sort of convulsion of nature
and the fish seemed to look upon it as an opportunity
for a Saturnalia.</p>

<p>In all rivers and lakes with which I am acquainted
I have found that the Salmon rise at
certain fixed hours morning and evening, and
sometimes also in the middle of the day. As
salmon do not rise from hunger, as far as we
know, it is difficult to understand why this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
should be. I leave the explanation to others
and merely state the fact as I have found it. In
that part of the Hampshire Stour with which I
am best acquainted, the hours for rising were
five in the morning, one p.m., and sunset. At
one p.m. the fish were so regular in their habits
that the servants' dinner-bell, which rang at that
hour and was audible for some miles round, came
to be called the Salmon bell.</p>

<p>In Dhulough, Delphi, and Glendalough lakes,
in County Mayo, the fish were lotus-eaters, and
preferred the afternoon for intercourse with the
human race.</p>

<p>In Pool Persyn, on the Usk, near Brecon, they
never rose, as far as we could find out, before
twelve o'clock, or between two and four, when I
presume they had their siesta. No doubt a great
deal depends on the time of year and the amount
of daylight. These peculiarities in a river can
only be ascertained by experience, or by consultation
with someone who knows the water, and
should never be disregarded, as for all we know
to the contrary, fish may get used to the sight of
a fly which is constantly being dangled before
their nose, and end by paying no attention to it.</p>

<p>Another very important matter is to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
oneself acquainted with the haunts of the fish,
the spots where they lie and rest on their way up
the river&mdash;I do not say "down" as well, because
they must not then be caught at all, owing to
their condition.</p>

<p>In fine weather, therefore, when the sun is bright
and the water low, the wise fisherwoman will leave
her rod at home and walk along the bank, slowly
and carefully examining the bed of the river and
ascertaining, as far as she can, where the fish are
lying and where the rocks and roots of trees, or
"snags," as they are called, are situated. This
knowledge will assist her to cast her fly in the
right and not in the wrong place, and may avoid
the loss of a fish which would otherwise either
accidentally or of <i>malice prepense</i> entangle the line
and snap it by means of a resistance which he
cannot get from a lissom rod and a running line.</p>

<p>This is such a favourite trick with pike that
it amounts to a recognised dodge, and would
almost seem to be the result of some form of
reasoning, however dim.</p>

<p>To flog the river for hours at a stretch,
without having first ascertained these simple
facts, at a wrong time of day, or when, for
instance, the water is rising, is worse than useless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
for it disgusts the angler, and renders her incapable,
from sheer fatigue, of throwing a light fly
when at last there is really a chance of a prize.
Casting, let us say, from forty to sixty feet of
line with a heavy rod is hard work for any
woman; indeed, most men return from their
first day's sport with a stiffness in the muscles of
the back and shoulders which it takes a vast
amount of "Elliman" to alleviate.</p>

<p>It is most important for a woman, in fishing
for salmon, to husband her strength, otherwise,
if she hooks a heavy fish and is already tired out,
she may find it a difficult matter to play it safely,
and to land it eventually, after perhaps following
and keeping strain on him for some distance over
unequal ground.</p>

<p>Thick waterproof boots, made high in the
legs, gaiters if required, a short skirt, a blouse or
tennis flannel, strong belt of leather or webbing
and loose jacket, with a small hat well fixed on
head, is the most suitable costume to go out fishing
in. I take for granted that most women
will not care to wade, a practice which is dangerous
to health and sometimes to life itself,
even when waders are used, as few women so
hampered could regain their footing in a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
current once they had lost it, or if they accidentally
stepped into a hole.</p>

<p>Quiet colours, heather mixture and the like,
should be worn, as fish, and more especially
trout, have a quick eye for a bright patch.
White objects are to be avoided. It is a well-known
trick with poachers to send a large piece
of white paper floating down stream. Not a fish
will rise for hours afterwards. It seems to affect
them as flying a kite does partridges&mdash;they lie
close and can be netted afterwards with ease.</p>

<p>Salmon are distinctly less clever than trout, and
the same precautions against being seen are not so
necessary, although always advisable even in the
case of the former, which will also be attracted
by a much coarser form of lure. No doubt the
reason is partly that we fish for salmon and its
varieties&mdash;the sea and bull-trout&mdash;in deeper water
of which the surface, being broken by the current,
is roughened and intercepts their view of the
upper world. In trout streams this is not nearly
so much the case, as a rule, and where the banks
rise high above the water, trout require the
greatest care, coaxing and delicacy in handling to
induce them to exchange a comfortable home for
the angler's creel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>When salmon are rising, they will take almost
anything, and in thick or heavy water I have
caught them myself with the identical spoon-bait
which I used for mackerel in the sea.</p>

<p>It is difficult to fathom what is in the salmon's
mind when he takes either a spoon or a boiled
prawn, objects which he can never have met
with in the sea in his natural state, but many fish
will come at the fly merely to drown it by striking
at it with their tail, and are ingloriously "foul-hooked"
in consequence. When this happens
they are far more difficult to kill, and often lead
their captor a pretty dance before being finally
gaffed or netted, the tail fin not being so sensitive
as the mouth, which the fish can therefore close,
thus swallowing no water when the strain begins
to be severe.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Before starting for a day's fishing it is necessary
thoroughly to examine the rod and tackle which
are to be used. I recommend from personal experience,
for a woman, a light, well-balanced rod
about sixteen or seventeen feet in length. Greenheart
is a very good wood,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and mine, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>made of this, has lasted for years and is, apparently,
none the worse. All depends on the care
which is taken of it during the time it is not
being used. I have always kept my rod in a
moderately warm place, where neither the damp
could get at, to warp and swell the wood, nor
too great dryness make it brittle, and before
beginning the season I varnish it carefully to
preserve it from wet. Spare tops should be
always kept ready in case of an emergency, but
the accomplished sportswoman will of course
learn how to splice a broken joint, as accidents
do not always occur within reach of assistance.
Each joint, unless made with screw fastenings,
is provided with brass eyes; a piece of waxed
thread should be fixed to these so that, being
wound round an eye in each joint, the whole rod
can be securely put together.</p>

<p>Having omitted this precaution on one occasion
when I was fishing for pike, I cast into the
river, with my bait, the top joint of my trolling
rod, which floated in the water, but did not,
strange to say, prevent my hooking and landing
a fish of seven or eight pounds.</p>

<p>Examine the reel carefully; take it to pieces,
oil it, if necessary, and work the handle to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that it runs smoothly without a hitch before
winding on the line. Large heavy reels and
coarse tackle are, to my mind, very inartistic and
unsuitable for women, as they naturally lessen
the chance of hooking a fish, although, once
hooked, all the angler has to do is to hold on,
"show the butt" persistently, keep the point of
the rod well up and tire out the fish by main
force.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 630px;">
<img src="images/illus-200.jpg" width="630" height="315" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Knot for Gut Loop.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>This manner of proceeding has always seemed
to me to be taking an unfair advantage of a
salmon or trout. With a pike, of course, the
question is a different one, as he cuts the line
with his teeth, if you give him the chance and
nothing but gimp is of any service. The rings
through which the line runs should also be
examined to see that
they are secure and that
the line itself, which is
best of hemp for salmon-fishing
is free from
kinks and not chafed
anywhere, also that it is wound evenly on the
reel, from which it must run lightly and
easily.</p>

<p>A check in the running of the line, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
large fish makes a sudden dash, would almost
certainly enable him to break away. Many
people waterproof or varnish the line to keep it
from rotting, and its usual length is from sixty
to seventy yards, the gut cast at the end being
generally about three more and stained (according
to the colour of the water in which it is to be
used) either with tea or coffee, or else ink and
water.</p>

<p>One very important point is to wet both line
and cast thoroughly before using; the former
should be run through the rings in the rod, and
casts made on a lawn or other open space for
practice and to remove kinks if any. Lines must
be thoroughly dried after use.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 541px;">
<img src="images/illus-201.jpg" width="541" height="61" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Ordinary method of
tying Gut.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Most women buy their tackle ready made, or
are accompanied by an expert
fisherman, but, if breakage in
the cast takes place and no
help be at hand, they should
know how to make a single and double slip-knot,
and how to put on fresh flies in case of need. It
should always be remembered that the two ends
of gut about to be joined should be thoroughly
moistened before they are manipulated. Otherwise
the knots will not bind and the gut will break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Method of fastening
Dropper to Cast.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>It is better for a woman, if not an expert, to
keep to one fly, that at the
end of the cast, called the
tail fly, unless she is fishing
for sea-trout in which case a
smaller one, called the dropper,
may be employed a little
higher up the cast, or it may
be advisable to use two different
kinds of salmon flies, but they are apt to
get entangled and give a great deal of trouble,
without any conspicuous advantage. This is
particularly the case where casting is interfered
with by high rocks, or trees and branches just
behind the fisherman.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/illus-202-2a.jpg" width="248" height="147" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Dropper and Cast.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The length of my own favourite salmon and
trout rods are seventeen and eleven
feet respectively, but many people
recommend a length of not over
fourteen for the former, as a woman's
strength is so much less than a man's.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/illus-202-2b.jpg" width="293" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Dropper and Cast.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>My own experience is, that in
casting against a strong wind, a
stiffish rod of eighteen feet is quite
within my powers, so much depending
on the balance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
whole apparatus, the size of the reel and weight
of the butt. In quiet weather my "Castle Connell,"
a foot less in length and much more supple
was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Marvellous tales are told of long casts, but
personally I have found sixty feet or thereabouts
to be the length of my tether, at least so far as
a satisfactory performance is concerned. This
distance is usually quite enough for all practical
purposes, and it will be some time before the
angler can be certain of dropping his fly lightly
and surely on a given spot, even at forty feet.</p>

<p>Women should practise casting on lawns without
a cast at the end of their lines, as, when the
fly is on, a novice has been known to hook
swallows and even inquisitive puppy-dogs. The
"Spey" cast should be studied as well as the
ordinary method, the former being most useful
where there are high branches or rocks just
behind the place where the angler must stand.</p>

<p>The "Spey" cast consists in so switching the
line that it shoots out direct to the required spot
without ever passing behind the angler's head,
while in the more ordinary method, the great
secret is to send the line right out at the back,
and then with a dexterous turn of the wrist to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
bring it forward. By raising the tip of the rod
slightly just before the fly touches the water, it
will fall into its position in a light and natural
manner. Casting requires great care and patience
in practising, and many a time the beginner may
find her flies firmly embedded in her own back
hair, instead of speeding swiftly through the air
to where the fish lies.</p>

<p>In casting a line either for salmon or trout it
should be noted that fish always lie with their
heads up-stream, and that it is therefore necessary
to stand some distance above where they are
supposed to be, and cast across the water so that
the fly may fall delicately and gently, without
the least splash, a little above their noses. It
cannot be too often repeated that, in fishing for
trout, the great art is <i>not to be seen</i>. The angler
must therefore stand well back from the bank,
hide behind trees and bushes and crouch in hollows.
Above all, it is absolutely essential that
the figure should never be seen against the sky.
She must keep her face to the sun, that her
shadow may not fall on the water, throwing her
fly first of all under the near bank and then by
successive casts across the stream.</p>

<p>The salmon cast is naturally a longer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
slower movement than that which is used for
trout, but in both instances it is often well
to allow the fly to sink a little before beginning
to play it. For salmon the line
should be drawn gently and with successive
movements of the wrist up-stream and across
the space which intervenes between the spot
where the fly has fallen and that at which the
angler stands. The trout cast is much more
rapid, and the playing should be across and down
stream as well as up, the movements of the
wrist being much lighter and more varied. In
both cases, when a fish is felt, a "strike" should
be made, at least, authorities, to whom I am
bound to bow, insist on this ceremony. Personally
I believe that the fish, by this sharp turn of
the wrist, is as often lost as hooked, unless care
be taken to chose the actual moment when he
has closed his jaws upon it. I have seen a fly
pulled right out of a salmon's mouth, and have
been told by those looking on and instructing me
that I had done that same thing myself, when I
merely intended to strike. My impression is,
therefore, that the novice had better let her
salmon hook themselves, which they will certainly
do if they come well at the fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>The cast itself requires careful examination
before it is used; it should be stained to the
required colour and tested with a steelyard up
to sixteen or seventeen pounds for finer tackle,
and eighteen for that which is coarser. Trout-casts,
will not, of course, require or bear so
severe a strain, but should be tried to see whether
there is any defect either in the gut or in the
knots which unite the several lengths of which
they consist.</p>

<p>Few women, I imagine, will care to make
their own casts, although some do, and for those
I may mention that the best and cheapest gut is
to be had in the South of Spain, where it is
about one-third of the price which it fetches in
England. Fly-making is very pretty work for
delicate fingers but tedious and, on the whole,
not very remunerative, as flies can be bought
very cheap now-a-days. They may not be quite
so carefully finished as those of home manufacture,
but they are, I must admit, equally killing,
although for years I placed implicit faith in the
latter.</p>

<p>There was one fly for which I had a special
fancy; it is a combination of orange-coloured
silks and tinsel for the body with pheasant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
jay for the wings, peacock for the head and
golden pheasant for the tail. On one occasion,
this "Orange Body" of private manufacture was
presented to a friend, who admired it greatly and
sallied forth, on slaughter bent.</p>

<p>He hooked a salmon almost with the first cast,
struck with decision, and behold, all the dressing
of the hook including of course the eye, came
away and he lost his fish.</p>

<p>What had happened? The secret was this:
that the cobbler's wax used for fly-making had
been mislaid, and an ordinary piece of wax-candle
used instead, the result being that the fish went
away with the hook in his mouth while the rest
of the fly remained to adorn the cast.</p>

<p>Test your flies, therefore, see that they are
thoroughly sound and that the eye and piece of
gut by which they are fastened to the cast are
not frayed. It is a good thing to try a new fly
in a basin of water or shallow pond to see
whether it floats, as it should, horizontally, and
whether the wings have a life-like motion, as by
repeated short movements you play it with your
hand.</p>

<p>Attention to all these little matters may seem
very irksome at first, but it is by these means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that one angler will succeed when another who
precedes him on the same ground, will obtain no
sport.</p>

<p>To give an accurate description of the different
kinds of flies used in salmon and trout fishing,
would be quite impossible in so short an article
as the present one, but it should be said that, as
a general rule, the deeper and larger the river
the larger and brighter will be the flies required.</p>

<p>In thick or heavy water, after a flood, large
bright coloured flies are indicated, and the clearer
the stream the smaller must be the size, and the
more neutral the colours tend to become. Most
authorities seem to agree that the size of flies is a
much more important factor in their killing qualities
than the special materials of which they are
made, or the finish and delicacy of their manufacture.
When fish do not seem to be rising it is well
to try them with another colour or make, and this
will often enable the angler to fill his basket,
when otherwise the day's sport must have been
marked with a "duck's egg."</p>

<p>The same general rules also apply to trout
fishing, but it should be remembered that in the
latter case, except when fishing in lakes or rivers
for the larger species which may fairly be angled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
for as salmon, the shallow water, enabling the
lure to be plainly seen, requires less gaudy colours,
and, of course, an immense reduction in size.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention the gaff and the
landing-net, most important parts of the angler's
outfit. The former is best for large fish, under
which it is much more difficult to get a net.</p>

<p>There is always a great controversy raging as
to whether it is best to gaff "over" or "under,"
and the right place to accomplish the former is
said by some authorities to be the back just at the
shoulder. Personally I belong to those who gaff
"under," and have always found it much easier
than the other.</p>

<p>When a fish is brought close to the bank,
sometimes only half or three-parts killed, he will
generally make a dash for his life when he sees a
murderous-looking steel instrument close to him,
so it must be concealed from his view, and it is a
good plan to have the gaff pretty deep in the
water before he is brought up to it then striking
under and drawing the gaff sharply forwards and
upwards. I have landed some very heavy fish in
this way, and scarcely ever missed one.</p>

<p>Once I gaffed a beautiful salmon of at least
eighteen pounds, on the Usk, landed him trium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>phantly,
and stood admiring him while the fly
was taken out of his mouth. He seemed quite
dead, but just as we turned away to what we
hoped would be fresh conquests, with a vigorous
flap of his tail, he managed to slide over into the
river and was lost to view. I am afraid he was
mortally wounded by the gaff, and must have
died before long. This was a lesson to me to
remove my fish to some distance from the water's
edge and to make sure that they were really dead
before leaving them. The net should be used
for "red" or "black" fish, which must be returned
to the river on account of their condition,
with as little injury as possible.</p>

<p>Grayling are not usually considered as interesting
to catch as salmon and trout, for, although
they will sometimes make a desperate fight for life,
they will only too often sink down to the bottom of
the stream and remain there. They must be fished
for with the same precautions against being seen
which are used for trout, and with several flies
on the cast, as they often move in shoals. They
usually lie in the middle of the river, in its lower
reaches towards the sea, and when these are
broad, the angler is often compelled to wade to
get the best chance at them. They are caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
with the fly as well as worms and other bait.
The cast should be made up-stream.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention dry-fly fishing,
which is particularly suitable for women. This
form of angling is usually necessary in chalk
streams, where trout will often refuse to be
tempted by any other. The cast must be made
up-stream so that the fly drops on the nose of the
fish in a natural manner, and floats on the top of
the water. The moment the fly gets wet it is
useless, and must be dried by making two or three
false casts in the air before returning to a real one
on the stream. The fly must be worked with
the greatest delicacy of touch, and allowed to
float down with the current on the surface of the
water.</p>


<h3>COARSE FISH.</h3>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Lead for Spinning. Double Swivel.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The above title includes pike, perch, roach,
dace, chub, bream, barbel, and tench, the last of
which is very
good eating, its
fat being almost
like that of the turtle. When the nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
varieties are not to be obtained, coarse fish are by
no means to be despised, either for the table or
for sporting purposes, and many a happy day
may be spent on rivers and lakes at a time of
year when perhaps neither salmon nor trout are
available.</p>

<p>My experience of pike fishing has been
chiefly in the Hampshire Stour, which has a gravelly
bottom, so that those fish,
which are apt to be muddy in
flavour, were superior to any
I have tasted caught elsewhere.
They are to be taken
either with a float and live
bait, or else with a trolling-rod
and spinning tackle, baited
with a dace or other small
fish. After the care and tact
which must be displayed in
salmon, and especially in
trout fishing, pike seem to be
of a very inferior order of
intellect. No concealment of one's person at
the river-side is absolutely necessary, though it
may be advisable sometimes, and the splash made
by the bait in the water when spinning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
which is enough to frighten all the trout in the
pool, does not seem to affect the appetite of the
fish we are now dealing with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 586px;">
<img src="images/illus-213.jpg" width="586" height="299" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Bickerayke's Snap Tackle.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>As far as my experience goes, I should say
that gimp is the only thing that will hold a large
pike, whose tactics are to cut the line with his
teeth, or to wind it round a rock or root in the
bed of the river and so defeat his human enemy.
Even when safely landed he is still dangerous for
he has jaws like a tiger, fitted with large, sharp
teeth, which must be approached with caution.
The trolling-rod is short and stiff, with large
rings so that the line can run freely; the latter
cannot of course be wound on the reel when
fishing, unless in casting from the reel, but must
be drawn in by hand. Great care is required to
prevent entanglement, and the angler must beware
of treading on his line as he moves along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>I found, inside a pike of twenty-five pounds,
caught in the Hampshire Stour, a perch of three
pounds, which had been swallowed whole. The
pike had, apparently, only regarded this as a
<i>Hors d'&#339;uvre</i> and not as a square meal, since he
came to my dace with the greatest voracity.</p>

<p>Perch fishing has always had great attractions
for me, and I have caught many beautiful baskets
of them, also in the Hampshire Stour. They
are curious fish in some ways, and are to be found
in large companies in pools and lakes, at the
time of year when they are in season. When
they are on the shallows they are not fit to eat,
and will not usually take the bait. We fished
for them with a live minnow and float, sometimes
from the bank and sometimes from a punt.
They do not seem shy, and I have caught them
with my hand in the water holding the gut and
minnow, but if once a perch is lost, no more
will rise in that pool.</p>

<p>They must have some means of communication
with each other, for after such an event the
only thing to do is to move to another hole.
When, by the disappearance of the float under
water, the angler becomes aware that a fish has
taken the bait, a short time should be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
before striking as it must be remembered that
the perch has to swallow part of the minnow
before arriving at the hook. If left too long,
the perch will gorge the bait
(and this applies also to pike),
the result being very unpleasant
for all parties concerned.
I have also caught
perch with a worm, in which
case the bait should be almost
on the bottom of the river.
The great attraction in this
sport is that you can fish on
a brilliantly fine summer's
day, and see the objects of
your attentions swimming
about and playing regardless
of you in the deep clear
water.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><i>Pennell Flight for

</div>

<p>It is said that certain kinds
of trout croak, but that roach
do, I myself can testify, and
so distressing is the noise they
emit that when I have caught
them by accident, I always returned them to the
water with great despatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Carp and tench are exceedingly shy fish and
both prefer muddy and weedy ponds to a clear
running stream. In
the former they may
be caught with paste
and other forms of
bait, but, to my
mind, are hardly
worth the trouble
and, if wanted for
the table may just as
well be circumvented
with a net, for
all the sport they
afford.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/illus-216.jpg" width="304" height="647" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Pennell Flight for Large Baits.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Barbel and bream
are very dull fish to
catch with a rod and
line; the former especially
dive at once
and burrow sulking
in the mud, opposing
merely dead
weight to the angler's efforts. Dace and chub
only remain to be noticed. The former will take
a fly very readily, and give very good sport for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
their size, while chub are as shy as trout and as
difficult to catch, if once they obtain a sight of
their antagonist on the bank.</p>

<p>It has only been possible to give a very short
account of the various kinds of fresh-water fish,
and numerous questions will occur to the novice
in angling, which must be elucidated partly by
study of the many excellent volumes already
published on the subject, but chiefly by experience
and consultation with men who possess
special knowledge of their own locality.</p>

<p>Still, I hope I have said enough to encourage
women to look into the science of angling for
themselves, and not to be entirely dependent on
the services and advice of anyone who may
chance to accompany them.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-221.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> subject far from being treated
exhaustively, or even with any attempt
at fulness, will, on the contrary,
only be written of, so as to give a few
hints to those who love to wield the rod. Bottom
fishing, with the paraphernalia necessary to that
branch of the sport, has objections at least from
a woman's point of view, but to fishing with the
fly there is no drawback, unless indeed you happen
to be one of those who hold that you should
never pit your skill against one of the lower
animals in a struggle for life. Of all sports indeed
there is none more entirely suited to the
powers of woman than fly-fishing. The nicety,
the quickness, the light-handedness, and care as to
details, and I think I may add <i>thoroughness</i> in any
pursuit they really take to, in which women
generally excel are all points in her favour the
moment she takes a rod in hand. Great strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
is not needed, unless indeed she choose to go after
one of the leviathans of the deep, but only constant
and exhaustless patience. Yet it is the mention
of the last that will make many who know
only of the sport by hearsay, look scornful and
say they see no fun in standing watching and
waiting for the bite that often never comes, and
that they prefer something more active. As it is
no use arguing with people who are persuaded
they view the subject from a vastly superior
standpoint, the only answer to this is, "If you do
not change your opinion after a week's&mdash;or even
a day's&mdash;experience&mdash;well, fly-fishing is not for
you."</p>

<p>What I am anxious to impress upon all is, that
fly-fishing is not necessarily an expensive sport.
For the best of salmon-fishing and the right to
try for trout in their choicest waters you must
indeed pay, but for the right to fish for their less
thought of brethren there need be but small demands
on your purse.</p>

<p>My own experience one summer may be of
some use to those who would fain do likewise.
My lot was cast in a part of Sussex where under
the Downs flowed a tiny but most beautiful little
river. "No trout," had been the answer given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
when I enquired as to the prospect of sport from
its banks, so sadly I made up my mind that beyond
an occasional visit to a trout stream, owned
by some friends in the same county, my rod
would be idle that summer.</p>

<p>"If only it <i>was</i> stocked with trout," was my
frequent reflection as I wandered along its banks
and noted the swift flowing current and the tempting
stickles that looked a perfect paradise from a
trouting point of view. One evening as I
stood watching the clear waters as they rushed
round and over some opposing rocks into a large
pool, I caught sight of a silvery, most graceful
fish dart through the water at the side of the
eddy. Then when my eye became accustomed
to the curious light, as the rays of the setting sun
fell slantways over the pool, through the branches
of a mighty oak tree that rose from the banks, I
saw another, and another. "Dace," was my
verdict, and forthwith dismissed them from my
mind. But I had not reached home before the
thought of trying for those dace with fly came to
me, and the next day, trout rod in hand, and with
a Black Palmer and Alder on the cast, I made
my first venture in what was to me quite a new
branch of sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 649px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>Method of fastening Dropper to Cast.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>As the line
flew out for
the second
time and the
flies fell gently
and lightly
on the
water, I had
but to wait a second before a faint thrill ran
through my hand and told me <i>something</i> had
touched the fly. Could it be a bite? So different
was it to the sudden onslaught of a trout,
that I hesitated whether or not to strike, and
contrary to the usual fate of the waverer, it was
the momentary pause which gave me the fish.
A slight movement of the wrist and I had him
fast, and then a delicious few minutes followed
while I played as game a dace as I ever wish to
measure skill with. Indeed I should not have
been surprised when at last my prize was safely
caught in the landing net, to see the spotted
scales of a trout. But no, the slender, silvery,
beautiful-headed fish could be no other than a
dace, and his captor at least was content with the
gallant bid he had made for his life.</p>

<p>If dace would take the fly, why not also roach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and chub, and soon, <i>faute de mieux</i> it is true, but
none the less with very considerable enjoyment,
I was fishing the little stream for all three kinds
in turn. On the gravelly bottom of a certain
portion of the water, I found a red Palmer very
attractive to the roach which were there in considerable
numbers. Some of them were of fair
size, the largest I took turning the scales at 1-lb.,
but I am bound to confess that I found these fish
such very shy biters that I generally preferred to
try either for dace or chub. One roach, however,
gave rather a novel experience by hanging
itself in a tree, and causing the greatest excitement
among our party, the members of which
quickly came from their chosen spots to see and
admire. I was fishing from the shelter of a bush
on the top of a high steep bank, and with some
trees close at the rear and a decidedly fresh
breeze blowing, it was not an easy matter to get
the line safely out at all. The water, however,
was but little disturbed by the wind, from which
just there it was protected by the high ground,
and the fish were clearly visible in the water below.
As there was nothing for it in such a position
but to swing the fish out if I caught one, I
did not for that once wish to make a big capture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Scarcely had the tail fly&mdash;this was a red Palmer&mdash;touched
the water than one of the usual shy
bites was made, and fortunately my strike secured
the prize so far. But he seemed heavy and was,
besides, the gamest of his kind I have ever
played. Quietly we could not manage things,
and it was very soon clear that if I did not
then secure him, I need not struggle with the
difficulties of casting again in that part of the
stream, for every other finny inhabitant would
have taken the alarm. All my faculties were
therefore intent on the capture. When I saw
him at last tired of struggling and almost beneath
me, I tried to swing him up, wondering, as I did
so, if it were possible my light tackle could stand
the strain. A flash of silver through the air,
then a puff of wind, and a red-finned, black-backed
roach of about 8-oz. in weight, was dangling
over the topmost bough of a tree which
grew up from the lower part of the bank a little
to my left. The poor fish struggled and the line
swayed ominously among the branches, till at
last a nimble climber released them both, and to
my delight restored them to me.</p>

<p>For chub I found a larger fly effective, and a
Coachman and a Red Palmer, both tied large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
were what I generally used. In my experience,
chub is the most determined biter of any of those
I am now discussing, and he is very game up to
a certain point, his dashes and struggles as he
tries to free himself from the hook, being as
fierce as those of many a good trout. The battle,
however, will be over much
sooner than with one of the
latter species, and when you
see the inert form in the water, you will realise
with sorrow that after all he does not belong to
the kind known as "game fish." In fishing for
chub you must be as careful about showing yourself
as you would be in trying for a trout, for he
is very quick in spotting anything unusual, and
once he has done this, you may offer him the
most tempting flies unavailingly. By the time
you have landed a 2-lb. chub, you will, in my
opinion, have exercised to the full as much, if
not more skill, than you would have done in the
capture of a trout, and though the sport of playing
him will be sooner over, it will have been good
indeed while it lasted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 558px;">

<div class="caption"><p><i>Method of fastening Reel-line
to Cast.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The chub I found to rise earlier in the day in
this little Sussex stream than either dace or roach,
the two last on the warm August evenings often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
rising freely as long as we could see to cast for
them.</p>

<p>The great difference between fishing with the
fly for game and coarse fish lies in this, that while
with the latter you require even more lightness
of hand and skill in casting than on any ordinary
trout stream, the intense excitement of the moments
when you play a good trout or salmon will
not be experienced to the same extent. But that
sport and good sport may be enjoyed with any of
the three varieties I have named, I have proved
to my own satisfaction, and I hope that what I
have said may induce others to try for themselves.</p>

<p>At the same time that nothing can equal the
joy of playing and landing your first trout, I
would be the last to deny, for the day on which
the first fell to my rod is still marked as a red
letter day in my life. This also was in Sussex,
in a well-stocked merry little stream which
babbled and chattered over its white stones, giving
the last touch of beauty to the peaceful valley
through which it flowed. After the preliminary
walk along the banks of that part of the water I
was to fish, so as to get the knowledge of the
position of the pools and eddies and overhanging
banks without which one's labour is likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
thrown away, I sallied forth, rod in hand, to the
neighbourhood of a bridge from which I had
noted several trout lying with their heads up
stream. A few hundred yards from this, where
the banks it is true did not seem to offer much
facility for casting, there was an eddy at one side
of the stream and a mass of rushes on the other,
all under the shadow of trees which rose between
them and the bridge. When it is remembered
that I was trying for my first trout&mdash;the experience
now lies back in the dim distance of the
past&mdash;it will not perhaps cause surprise if I say
that my whole being thrilled with the excitement
of the moment. My cast had a red Palmer for
the tail fly, and black Alder as dropper, for at
dinner the night before I had been advised to try
these by a local fisherman. I should probably
make a mess of it, and catch my line in one or
other of the traps that literally bristled on all
sides of me, was the thought that was uppermost,
as after scrambling down cautiously and keeping
well out of view, I craned my neck to see how I
could possibly get my cast to alight on the spot
I had chosen. As I had my hand up for the
venture a swift rise just where my eyes were fixed
on the water, told me of the presence of a trout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
My line flew out, and the tail-fly falling within
the widening circle was instantly seized, and a
sharp turn of the wrist gave me a trout with a
bewildering suddenness. Up went the point of
the rod, and the good cane bent to the weight
beneath. A maddened dash across stream to the
reeds, was the first attempt of the prey, then a
trial to get to the shelter of a rock conveniently
near, but slowly and surely he gave in to the
steady pull brought to bear on him, and soon I
looked with unspeakable delight on a &frac12;-lb. trout,
in the prime of condition, safe within the folds of
the landing net. That no fish ever comes up to
the one you first capture, has since this moment
been an article of faith with me. Others larger,
gamer, better in every sense may, and will if you
have ordinary skill and perseverance, fall to your
rod, but nothing will give you the same thrill of
rapture you felt when you saw your "first trout"
on the bank at your feet.</p>

<p>To make a good trout fisher there are of
course many things to learn, and one of the
greatest charms of the sport lies in this, that you
never come to the end of what there is to know
of it. But pre-eminently is it true that an ounce
of practice is worth a ton of precepts. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to a very great extent buy your own experience,
and though you will always do well to profit by
other people's advice,
you must yourself
build up the theories
which will show you
how, when, and where
to cast so that fish
may rise to your fly,
when they are proof
against the blandishments
of the less skillfully-thrown
lure.
That you should always
study the lie of
the water over which
you mean to fish is a
truism, and yet it is a
fundamental rule to the neglect of which many
both men and women owe the fact, that they
never rise above a very mediocre degree of skill.
Unless you know something of the habits of the
fish and the spots in which he is likely to be
found, how can you hope to succeed in making
him acquainted with your fly? To prevent him
catching a glimpse of you, and for this end to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
dressed so as scarcely to be distinguished from
the ground upon which you will be standing, to
make no noise or disturbance, to throw with the
utmost delicacy of hand, to strike instantaneously
or the reverse according to the particular class of
fish you are angling for, to cast up stream or
partly up and <i>across</i>, and never to allow the gut
to make a ripple as you draw your cast through
the water, all these constitute the ABC of an
angler's stock of learning.</p>

<p>I believe that most people carry about with
them a quite unnecessary stock of flies, and that
as much success will fall to you if you only provide
yourself with different kinds of Palmers,
Black and Red Gnats, the Black Alder, Red
Spinner, March Brown, Blue Upright, Yellow
Dun, Stone Fly, Wickham's Fancy, Greenwell's
Glory, and on some streams the Green Drake,
having these in several shades and tied on different
sized hooks, never forgetting to supplement
them by any others recommended by local fishermen,
whose knowledge remember has probably
been bought by careful study and long and
varied experience.</p>

<p>For coarse fish I have found the Palmers,
Black Gnat, Artificial Grub, and Bumble Bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the most successful. The Chub always liking
their fly tied large, the Dace and Roach preferring
theirs small.</p>

<p>A rod well-chosen and well-balanced is of
course of the first necessity to your success. To
speak again from my own experience, I found an
inexpensive light Greenheart made by Hancock,
a delightful rod in every respect and with this
my first ventures both with trout and coarse fish
were made. It only measured 10-ft. 6-in., but
was beautifully balanced, and you could make
very fairly long casts with it. As a beginner you
should always get some experienced friend to
choose your rod for you, though like everything
else of the kind, you will naturally prefer to
make the choice yourself as soon as you know how
to test the balance on which all else depends.</p>

<p>In the matter of outfit, you will need a creel
which should contain an upper tray for luncheon,
a landing net, and one or two casts ready made
for use. The last may be fastened round your
hat, and of course if you have any idea of being
independent and going out by yourself, your
creel and net should be chosen with a view to
lightness, or they will naturally add materially
to the fatigue of a day on the river bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, I would say, that if you should have
the opportunity of going out with a good fisherman
on a river or lake, there to learn the
elements of fly-fishing, by all means avail yourself
of it. In no other way can you master the
rudimentary practice so easily as from a boat, for
there will be no bushes or banks, or the hundred
and one difficulties you may have to consider on
land, and you will therefore be able to concentrate
your efforts on getting your line out in a
fairly workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>That you should not be easily discouraged it
is scarcely necessary to add, for who that has
landed her first trout has not straightway felt the
fever of the rod take possession of her?</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-237.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> the many forms of sport indulged
in by women there is in my opinion
none more fascinating than driving.
Single, pair, and tandem-driving are
within the capabilities of most women, though to
control a team thoroughly, especially with a full
coach behind it, requires exceptional skill, nerve
and strength. The first thing to learn when
beginning driving lessons is the proper position
and use of each piece of harness, the effect of
shifting the reins on the bit, the correct position
of the bit in the horse's mouth, and in pair or
team driving how the horses should be coupled
to go well together. There are no two horses
quite alike in character, and each one to go well
in harness requires attention to his individual
habits and characteristics. Very few people
realise how much unnecessary pain is caused to
horses by mere thoughtlessness. How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
people there are who to be "smart" have very
tight bearing reins, never dreaming of the agony
the poor animals are suffering when left waiting
as they often are at the front door, with their
mouths aching and their heads strained up. Yet
I do not by any means wish to condemn the use
of the bearing rein altogether, especially in a
crowded city, as it would be impossible to drive
many horses without one. Frequently, too, the
bit is put very much too high in the horses'
mouths, and then people wonder why the poor
animals are restless and fidgety while their
mouths are being pinched and cut.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 639px;">
<img src="images/illus-238.jpg" width="639" height="326" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Reins for Single Harness.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>There are so many things to be mentioned in
speaking of driving that it is difficult to know
where to begin,
what to leave
out, and what to
mention. I cannot
do better
than begin with
the start from the
front door. There are exceedingly few women
who have any idea how to start properly. I remember
once noticing a very good whip start.
She was ready when the cart came to the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
for she well knew that nothing is worse for an
animal than to be kept waiting. She went and
patted the pony, giving a glance at the harness to
see that it was all in its proper place. Finding
the throat lash too tight she let it out a hole,
then unfastening the reins from the off-side
terret, she took them in her right hand with the
second and third fingers between the two reins,
got in and sat down immediately. Putting the
rug over her knees, she then transferred the reins
to her left hand, the near rein over the first
finger and the off rein between the second and
third fingers, and took the whip in her right
hand. When she was quite ready to start, she
dropped her left hand and the pony moved off.
My first impression naturally was, "I am sure
that girl can drive," and I was quite right.</p>

<p>In driving there are so very many things to be
remembered and others to be avoided, that I
think a few good rules will be the easiest way of
mentioning them:</p>

<p>1. Both the reins should be held in the left
hand, on no account should either rein be taken
out of that hand.</p>

<p>2. The hand should be kept just above the
level of the waist, fairly close to the body, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
wrist being well bent so as to give plenty of
spring to the horse's mouth, the nails and thumb
turned towards the body and the elbow close to
the hip.</p>

<p>3. The reins should be kept close to the
knuckles, so as to avoid the possibility of their
slipping out of the hand.</p>

<p>4. The right hand should not be kept altogether
on the reins, but when on them it should
be slightly in front of the left, and the hands
should never be far apart.</p>

<p>5. To shorten either or both the reins push
them through the left hand from the front, with
the right.</p>

<p>6. To lengthen, pull them through the left
hand from the front with the right hand, never
let a rein slip.</p>

<p>7. Always hold the whip in the right hand
when driving.</p>

<p>8. The whip should be held where it balances
best, usually just below the collar, and the
thong should be kept fairly high so as to avoid
the possibility of the lash tickling the horse.</p>

<p>9. Never jerk a horse when starting, and
never flap the reins on his back.</p>

<p>10. If a horse does not start when you drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the hand slightly, draw the whip gently over his
withers.</p>

<p>11. When whipping a horse, with the exception
of leaders, always hit him in front of the
pad.</p>

<p>12. A kicker can often be stopped by a sharp
hit on the ears.</p>

<p>13. Always keep a steady, firm, though not
heavy hold of a horse's mouth, "feel" his mouth
all the time he is going.</p>

<p>14. When driving through a crowded thoroughfare,
remember there is traffic behind as
well as in front that must not be stopped unnecessarily.</p>

<p>15. Pass all the near-side traffic on its off-side.</p>

<p>16. When turning a corner or pulling up,
always indicate your intention, in the former case
by swinging the whip in the direction in which
the turn is being made, or in the latter by swinging
the lash straight above the head.</p>

<p>17. Always go fairly slowly round corners,
and keep to the near side.</p>

<p>18. Keep a horse well in hand on greasy wood
or asphalt, or when going down hill, and never
hurry going up a steep hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>19. Always look straight ahead, and on no
account at the traffic passing or being passed.</p>

<p>20. Never hit a horse when the right hand is
on the reins, as otherwise in using the whip the
hand necessarily goes forward and relaxes the
hold on the rein or reins.</p>

<p>Of course it is quite impossible to lay down
rules for everything, and a great deal in driving
can only be learnt by long and varied experience.
One often hears people talking of self-made
whips, but that term generally means people who
think they can drive and cannot. For anyone
beginning to drive it is essential to start by
taking lessons from a really first-class whip.
Most of the road coach-drivers give lessons. It
is quite as necessary to have good lessons to drive
one horse as it is to drive four, as the foundation
of pair, team, and tandem driving is to be able
to drive one horse perfectly.</p>

<p>A made pair is quite as easy to drive as a
single horse, but when it is a case of driving two
horses, which have not been previously in harness
together, it is quite a different matter. Nothing
looks nicer than to see a good pair of cobs in a
smart phaeton, going well, driven by a lady who
knows what driving means. Women who drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
well, as a rule, have light hands, though many
of them do not keep a sufficiently steady hold
on a horse's mouth. They so often forget that
it is a matter of the greatest importance to feel
their horse's mouth the whole time they are
going. It is not an easy matter to get any two
horses of about the same size to go well together,
unless the greatest attention is given to all the
lesser details. It is absolutely necessary that the
harness should fit well and be properly adjusted.
When starting two new horses it is as well to do
so with the couplings level and bitted cheek all
round. After they have gone a short distance it
can easily be seen whether they are going comfortably
and well together and each doing his
fair share of work. If they are not, the reason
can soon be discovered, and the fault rectified.
Very often one horse goes a good deal more
freely, and takes a stronger hold of the bit, and
in that case it will be necessary to see that the
other horse has sufficient room in the couplings,
and at the same time to put the free horse middle
bar if he is inclined to pull. Frequently though,
the mistake is made of shifting the reins on the
bit when only the couplings require altering.
Very few horses carry their heads quite alike, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
consequently will require more or less room in
the couplings as the case may he. Many horses
too do not carry their heads straight, and need
special attention. For instance: it the near side
horse carries his head over to the left, the off-side
rein will have to be shortened, which means the
buckle will have to be taken on the other horse's
off-rein. It requires the greatest care and nicety
to couple horses correctly, for it makes all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
difference as to the way in which they will go.
When putting two horses together it is as well if
possible to get them the same size, colour and
build. Size is the most important, and many
people consider colour the next to be considered,
but personally I think colour makes very little
difference as long as the horses are the same
stamp and go comfortably together. It is most
disagreeable to drive two horses together, one
having a long swinging stride, and the other
taking short "shuffling" steps. It is most trying
for the horses too, as the former is sure to do
more work than the latter, which to keep up will
be continually breaking into a canter.</p>

<p>When putting in a young horse for the first
time, it is best to put him in a brake with a
steady old horse which knows his work. The
off-side is best for the youngster just at first,
but he should be perpetually changed sides, as
otherwise he will be apt to develop numerous
bad habits, besides getting a crooked mouth.
When starting get somebody to hold his head
till ready to go, and then the man should run
beside him for a few minutes, without holding
him. Be sure to drop the hand to the horses
well as they move off, and do not on any account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
allow the young horse to be the first to get into
his collar, as if you do he will feel the whole
weight of the brake and the other horse, and be
unable to move, and will in all probability jib.
Once a horse has learnt that he can jib, it is a
most difficult habit to break him of. Therefore,
avoid letting a young horse find out that he can
do so. Very often a young horse will go better
through the traffic in London than he will
round the Park when it is empty, as in the traffic
there are so many things to occupy his attention
that he will forget to resent he is made to
work. If anything frightens him and he refuses
to pass it, get him led by and do not hit him,
as otherwise he will always associate that particular
thing with being hit, and think it is the
object of his fright which caused him to be
hit, and afterwards either jib when he sees it
again, or rush by it. Before a young horse is
driven he should be thoroughly accustomed to
having the harness on and the bit in his mouth.
It is best to have the harness put on with very
long reins, so that a man can walk behind him
and make him walk as it he were being driven.
His first lessons should be short so as not to
worry or tire him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Once a woman can drive <i>any</i> two horses
together and make them go well, she will probably
be capable of learning to drive a tandem or team.
It is very hard to say which is the better of the
two to begin with. Personally I think if both
are going to be taken up, it is as well to start
with a team, but it really makes very little difference.
Of course a team requires a great deal
more strength, but very often to drive <i>any</i> two
horses together makes a large demand on your
strength. One of the best ways of learning is to
watch a good driver, both going through the
traffic and driving in the country, and to pay
great attention to his hands as well as the horses,
so as to notice how the turns, etc., are done. An
easy means of doing this is to take the box seat
of a road coach when a professional is driving,
and afterwards to take lessons from a road coach
driver. A great deal can be learnt at first, simply
by watching a person's hands, noting how a loop
is made, how when the leaders are turning the
wheelers are kept "off" a corner, and how the
team is straightened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 622px;">
<img src="images/illus-248.jpg" width="622" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>How to take up Reins.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The most difficult thing for a beginner to learn
is how to start the horses properly, and how to pull
up well. It is absolutely necessary always to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
that the horses and harness are in their proper
places, and the horses correctly bitted, as anything
being out of place may easily cause a serious
accident. Avoid keeping the horses waiting once
they are ready to start. Go to the off-side wheeler
and take the reins first in the left hand, the first
finger between the lead reins and the middle finger
between the wheel reins, take them gently so
as not to touch the horses' mouths, then pull out
a good piece of the off reins, so that the buckles
and splicings may be about level when you are
seated. Transfer the reins to the right hand, the
middle finger between the lead and the third finger
between the wheel reins, get on the box, and
sit down immediately, so as to avoid being jerked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
off should the horses start suddenly. Then transfer
the reins back to the left hand. All reins do
not have the splicing quite in the same place, but
as a rule the buckles and splicing will be about
level. Gently feel the wheelers' mouths and then
the leaders', the latter should be standing away
from the bars. The near wheel rein may be a
trifle shorter than the off, as this is the most difficult
one to take up in a hurry. Be sure that the
leaders have plenty of head room when starting,
otherwise they will be likely to jib. Though the
wheelers should start the coach, if any one of the
horses is inclined to jib he should not be allowed
to feel the weight of the coach when moving off.
Once started the lead reins can easily be shortened
a trifle. Take the whip in the right hand, and
drop the left hand
well to the horses
just as they start,
and then bring it
back to its proper
place. Be careful
when dropping the
left hand not to bend forward and lean over the
reins; nothing looks worse. The proper position
of the left hand is about level with the waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the elbow close to the side, the wrist well bent,
and the fingers and thumb turned towards the
body, in fact practically the same as for driving a
single horse or pair, but as the driver is higher
over the horses and the weight of the reins is
greater the hand will probably be a trifle lower.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 617px;">
<img src="images/illus-249.jpg" width="617" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Position of Hands and Reins.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The horses must be continually watched so as
to see that each is doing his fair share of the
work and that the team is absolutely straight,
otherwise it will be quite impossible to get
through the traffic or to turn corners properly.
It is best always to shorten reins by pushing them
through from the front, but at first the beginner
will find it very difficult. If the team is not
going straight it can generally be put right by
either shortening or lengthening the two middle
reins&mdash;the off lead and the near wheel&mdash;these
being the two easiest to alter, being together.
Of course sometimes only one rein may be wrong,
and if that is the case it should immediately be
either pulled out or pushed through, or three
reins may be too long, and then it is very often
found convenient to lengthen the short one, and
then put the right hand on the reins some inches
in front of the left and slide the left hand up to
it. Shortening the reins by this method looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
far more workmanlike than by pulling them
through the left hand from behind, and it does
not jerk the horses in the mouth.</p>

<p>A team should always be kept well in hand,
and a steady though light pressure maintained on
their mouths. If a horse is found to be pulling
or boring, he should be differently bitted at once,
as every horse must be well under control.
Before turning a corner be sure that all the
mouths are felt, slacken the pace slightly, and
then point the leaders in the direction and make
the wheelers follow them round. A loop has to
be made in the reins as the horses must not turn
together, but the wheelers after the leaders. The
point or loop is made by placing the right hand
on the lead rein of the side to which the turn is
being made, some distance in front of the left
hand, this depends on the size of the turn and
whether the leaders answer quickly, the rein
must then be brought back to the left hand and
placed under the thumb, which forms a loop and
leaves the right hand free either to hit the
wheelers or be put on the reins to steady the
horses. When the leaders are round the corner
the loop can be allowed to slide gradually through
the hand, but should never be let go all at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
In bringing back the loop to the left hand, the
leaders must be watched so as to tell exactly how
much rein is required to be taken up, to make
them turn as desired. Free horses that have
been going in the lead for some time, especially
if they know the road well, will only require a
very small loop. Horses too, that have been in
the wheel long are apt to cut the corners very
short, as the wheeler on the side on which the
turn is being made, recognises the sign of the
leaders being about to turn, by feeling the lead
rein shortened at the side of his head.</p>

<p>In those cases what is called the opposition
point is made use of. For instance, turning to
the right the near wheel rein is looped over the
thumb, and the off lead is looped <i>under</i> the first
finger, to the left the off-wheel rein is looped
under the first finger, and the near lead under
the thumb. This is by far the easiest way of
making the opposition point, as by this means
either loop can be let out by itself if necessary.
Be careful when taking up a loop never to let the
left hand go forward to meet the right. The
right hand should always bring the rein back to the
left hand. By turning the left hand towards one,
the near reins get shortened, and by turning it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
outwards, away from one, the off reins get
tightened. A great deal can be done by giving
the hand. Again a slight curve to either side,
not a sharp turn, may be accomplished by placing
the right hand on the lead reins and one wheel
rein. For instance if an incline to the right
were being made, the right hand would take
hold of the lead reins and the near wheel. In
London, when the wood and asphalt are greasy,
it is best to drive slowly, as a coach is fairly
heavy and not easy for the horses to stop, in spite
of the assistance given by the brake. Going
through the traffic the bars should always chatter,
which means that the leaders should not be doing
their full share of the work, when turning, they
should be quite out of draught otherwise the pole
would most probably be snapped. Some coaches
have a foot brake, and this is very useful,
especially in traffic when a lady is driving and
has to pull up suddenly, and at the same time it
saves the horses' legs greatly, though it does not
do to make too frequent use of it. It is best
for a lady to have someone sitting on the
"brake seat," to put on the brake for going
down steep hills, but this person should never
touch the brake till he is told to do so, as only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the driver can know the exact moment when it
is required.</p>

<p>When coming to the top of a hill, before
going down always take a pull at the horses,
shorten all the reins, and make sure of feeling all
their mouths. The leaders should always be out
of draught going down hill, but they should on
no account be too far back on the bars as otherwise
knocking up against them might cause one
of the leaders to kick and get a leg over the
trace. Generally when shortening all the reins
on the top of a hill, the wheelers come so far
back that the leaders are brought right back on
the bars, and if anything, the lead reins have to
be let out. It is best to begin going down hill
fairly slowly, as the pace can always be increased,
but it is most difficult to lessen it. When pulling
up, run the right hand some way down the reins,
and bring it back to the left if possible. It is
as well to shorten the reins slightly in the left
hand previously. When putting the right hand
on the rein to steady the horses, it is a very good
plan to place it over three reins only, the third
and fourth fingers over the off rein and the first
and second fingers over one of the others. The
lead reins should never be buckled, and on road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
coaches none of the reins have buckles on them
as a rule.</p>

<p>One of the great difficulties to be overcome at
the beginning is the management of the whip.
A team whip should not be too heavy, especially
for a lady's use, but at the same time it ought not
to be very light. A whip should always be kept
hung up, and it is a very good plan to keep one
handy and have it down from the wall every day
for five or ten minutes' practice even after you
have learnt to fold it. The common way of
learning to fold or catch is to chalk a big
<img src="images/271.png" height="15" alt="" /> on
the wall, and beginning at the bottom of this go
upwards towards the right, swinging the lash upwards,
and then allowing it to come back to the
stick. The whip should be held with the first
finger pointing up the stick, and the lash under
the second finger. An expensive whip is by no
means necessary. Schomberg, in the Brompton
Road, has some useful ones at 14s. 6d. In choosing
a whip it is best to get a springy one, with
several knots on the stick near the quill so as to
keep the thong on the stick when folded. It
should balance well when held near the collar.</p>

<p>When on the box the whip should be held in
the right hand under the thumb, with the lash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
twisted a few times round the stick, which is also
held under the thumb. The lash should always
be in a big loop, so that there is not more than
six inches to spare beyond the hand. The
wheelers should always be hit before the pad with
the double thong, and the leaders should be hit
on the hind legs, by the end of the lash of course.
When about to hit the leaders unfold the whip
and bring the stick back to the side of the coach,
and then by a movement of the wrist send the
lash in the required direction under the bars.
Afterwards bring the thong back to the stick and
fold it up again. When the thong is on the
stick, put the left thumb through the loop that
is on the stick, pull off the lash and give it one
or two turns to the left. In hitting wheelers one
must remember that they cannot do their fair
share of work if the leaders have too much head
room, and it is quite useless hitting them without
first shortening the leaders' reins. Above all,
when driving a team, keep them well in hand
and feel their mouths.</p>

<p>Tandem driving in many respects closely resembles
team driving. The reins are held in the
same way, and the whip is practically the same
though generally rather lighter and the lash a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
trifle shorter, but this will depend of course on the
size of the horses you are driving. Many people
consider a tandem, even apart from the difference
in the weight of the reins, more difficult to drive
than a coach, but personally I have always considered
tandem driving the easier of the two; it
is easier to pull up in the traffic and you can turn
in a fairly small space, though to make the horses
go well they require neat, quick, handling, and
exceptionally light hands. Many horses will
make good tandem leaders that will not go in any
other form of harness; of course, there are many
too which make safe leaders, but at the same time
could not be called "good." A perfect leader
should be quick and free, and always be taking a
slight hold of the bit, he should go wherever he
is driven and not shy off omnibuses, etc. A slug
in the lead is most difficult to drive, and quite
takes away from the pleasure of a tandem.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of harness, with and without
bars. With bars is supposed to be the safer
of the two, but, if proper care is taken, there is
practically no danger without bars, as the leader
should never be allowed to get far enough back
to risk his getting a leg over the trace. To
turn, a loop can be taken up just the same as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
turning a team, but it is necessarily much smaller,
and great care must be taken not to allow the
leader to come completely round. Most corners,
if not sharp ones, can be turned by placing the
right hand over the lead reins and one wheel
rein, but a great deal depends on the give and
take of the left hand. This is a most important
thing, as a tandem turns very easily, a turn of
the wrist being usually sufficient to move the
horses across the road. When the right hand is
kept on the reins, it should be in the same position
as on team reins. When getting into the
cart the reins should also be taken the same way
as team reins, first in the left hand and then passed
to the right, and finally, when seated, transferred
back to the left hand. Before taking the
reins to get into the cart, the whip should always
be neatly folded and placed in the socket ready
for immediate use. Though the wheeler starts
the cart, the leader should have plenty of head
room, or otherwise he will be liable to jib. A
tandem is most useful for going fairly long distances
at a good pace, as the weight is not great
and the leader can do his full share of the work
going up hill. Except when going up hill a
leader should only do a very small share of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a><br /><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a><br /><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>work. If proper care is taken, the danger of a
tandem is by no means so great as is generally
supposed, and a good tandem is a most enjoyable
turn-out to drive.</p>

<p>I hope the foregoing hints may be of some use
to those interested in driving, who wish to become
steady and clever whips. The most necessary
things to ensure success are plenty of practice
in driving different horses, and great care and
attention to all the minor details. There is
nothing more enjoyable than road coach-driving,
in my opinion, except a day with foxhounds.
But women should not attempt coaching unless
they are fairly strong, and have had plenty of
experience.</p>

<p>Before I end I cannot help mentioning one
whip whose driving I have always particularly
admired, and that is Ernest K. Fownes, of Rocket
fame. I have often had the pleasure of seeing
him drive, and a useful lesson it has been each
time. It is most interesting to watch how he
goes through the thickest traffic, never stopping
it, and never seeming himself to stop, his horses
going as one.</p>

<h2><a name="CYCLING" id="CYCLING">CYCLING.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-265.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of cycling is distinctly a
many-sided one. While the same
general remarks which apply to the
subject of exercise for women, apply
also to the use of the cycle, we should remember
that though every woman is benefitted by exercise
of some kind, there are a few women who are
not fitted to ride the cycle at all. This may
seem a strong assertion from one who is devoted
to cycling, and who so thoroughly believes in its
health-giving properties. But though to the
practised rider cycling is much easier work than
walking, to the novice, or to the unskilled rider,
and even to the skilled rider who is out of
form, it becomes hard work. Especially in
learning, an amount of muscular effort is required
which some women are unfitted to undertake.
Therefore, we must assume that the would-be
cyclist is a person of average health, strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and activity, and to such an one, the cycle should
be a boon indeed. It is impossible to lay down
rules as to who is fit or unfit to take up the pastime,
for even doctors are sometimes much at
fault on this point. My own view is that any
girl, or older woman either, who is used to a
fair amount of exercise, should be able to cycle
and to cycle well, <i>in time</i>. But those with weak
hearts or similar complaints should not attempt
to cycle, any more than they should run upstairs
quickly or climb steep hills.</p>

<p>Before leaving the health view of cycling, I
wish to impress most strongly on all who take up
cycling the necessity of "taking it easily" at first.
Apart from the fact that actually the hardest
work is in the learning, it must be remembered
that even after the learner can ride without assistance,
the body has to become accustomed to an
entirely new form of exercise. If you took a good
walker and stopped her from all walking exercise
for a few months, how tired she would get when
she began again. This fatigue would continue
until her muscles had got into good order again,
and yet walking comes naturally to everyone.
Cycling does not come naturally, except in very
rare instances, so how much more necessary is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
to begin carefully, and let the body become
gradually accustomed to it. The girl who rides
ten or fifteen miles after being on a cycle only
once or twice, and who&mdash;from not having mastered
the art of riding&mdash;uses two or three times
more exertion over it than she need, would not
dream, perhaps, of walking five miles on end at
a good pace. Yet she then pronounces the cycle
"hard work," and says she finds no pleasure in it.
No wonder!</p>

<p>Really to appreciate cycling many conditions
are necessary, and that is why I called it a many-sided
subject at the outset. First of all it is
an active exercise, so those who have not been
in the habit of taking enough outdoor exercise
in other forms, must not expect to cycle with
comfort or enjoyment until they have gradually
got their general health, into a state which is
known as "fit." Then when the cyclist is fitted in
herself to enjoy riding, there are other things to
be considered, and these I put as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To ride correctly; (<i>b</i>) to have a good cycle,
suited to the particular requirements of the rider,
and properly adjusted; and (<i>c</i>) to look well.</p>

<p>First then as to Riding, and here we are met
by the reflection, how few women ride really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
well. It makes me sad to see how badly three-fourths
of the riders one meets are getting along,
and when I reflect how much more they would
enjoy themselves, and <i>how much better they would
look</i> if taken in hand for a time by a good tutor,
I feel angry at the so-called "Instructors" one
usually has to put up with at the average riding
school.</p>

<p>When you are learning, you should if possible
select a grass lawn, or failing this a quiet piece
of broad road, and practice on this <i>little and often</i>.
Short rides, even of a few yards, are valuable, if
done frequently. The pupil should not get
over-tired, or struggle on after her efforts become
worrying. She should take a rest and have
another turn a few hours later, and will then find
the result very different. To the novice my advice
is, do not trouble about mounting and dismounting
without assistance, as this will come
later as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The object must be to sit quite still in the
saddle, and not to rely on the handles. Good
riders never move their bodies at all, but ride
with their hands just resting lightly on the
handles, <i>not</i> pulling at them. In time it will be
found the machine can be steered by just slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
inclining the shoulders in the direction in which
it is wished to turn. Above all things when you
are learning do not fix your eyes on the front
wheel, but look ahead. This is essential.</p>

<p>When the machine goes naturally in a straight
line, then the rider will know that she is not
only sitting well, but has begun to acquire the
art of pedalling. There is a very great deal in
pedalling evenly, as this not only lessens the
labour but takes away all difficulty of steering.
When a rider sits well and pedals well, there is
practically no steering to be done, for the machine
will go automatically in the direction desired
by the rider, or so at least it will appear. The
saddle should be so adjusted that when the pedal
is at its lowest point, the foot of the rider should
be just able to drop on to it naturally, without
quite straightening the knee. A good way to
test this, is to stretch the toe out as far as it will
go (knee quite straight) and if the foot will just
go underneath the pedal, no more, the length of
reach is correct.</p>

<p>Force should never be exerted in driving the
pedals, they must be "coaxed" round, for this in
a word is the art of "ankling." When the pedal
is at the top of the stroke, the heel should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
downward as in Fig. 1. As the pedal travels
forward and down, the
foot should follow it,
keeping the ankle as still
as possible, till at the
bottom of the stroke, the
toe is pointing downwards,
and the heel is
highest. The effect of
this will be first of all
to give power in riding
as shown by Fig. 2. If the foot is pressed
downward only, it will be
in operation for a very
small part of the stroke,
as the pedal moves in a
circle, but by ankling, it
will easily be seen (Fig. 3)
that power is maintained
for a much longer time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/illus-270a.jpg" width="233" height="297" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 1.</i></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus-270b.jpg" width="225" height="245" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 2.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>From a woman's point of
view too the effect of ankling is still more important,
as beside the gain in speed, it promotes
gracefulness. The rise and fall of the knee in
riding, is reduced by one half when the ankles
are used properly, and the result to the onlooker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
is consequently more pleasing. For the skirt to
hang gracefully and the rider to look well, there
should be as little movement of the knees as
possible. Therefore, if you sit sufficiently high
and use your ankles properly, you will not only
be using your powers to the very best advantage,
and lessening fatigue, but will at the same time
be attaining gracefulness, and in every way improving
your appearance in the saddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 634px;">
<img src="images/illus-271.jpg" width="634" height="391" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 3.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another important point is to keep the legs
<i>straight up and down</i> when riding. The knees
should not be allowed to go either inwards or
outwards on any account, and there should be no
"wobbling" in the leg action. The toe and
heel should be in a line, at right angles across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the pedal, that is, exactly parallel with the crank
all the time. Take care that the heel does not
twist at all (Fig. 4) on the stroke.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/illus-272.jpg" width="363" height="565" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 4.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Learn to mount from either
side of the machine, and to do so
lean the machine a little toward
you with the outside pedal up,
and rather forward, then place
your foot on the pedal furthest
from you, and as you raise yourself
into the saddle, the weight of your body
will bear on that pedal, thus sending the opposite
one up to meet the other foot.</p>

<p>The dress should be caught in the hand as you
put your foot across the machine on to the pedal,
and if any further arrangement should be necessary
you will, when you are at home in the saddle,
find it easy to do this as you go along. A
slight pull to the side will be all that is required.
When once in the saddle, do not be anxious to
find the other pedal, simply keep the machine
straight, as it will run a surprising distance of its
own accord after the start given to it by the act
of mounting, unless, indeed, you should be
mounting up hill, which is never desirable for a
beginner to attempt. If the foot which was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the ground is allowed to hang downwards as
soon as the rider is seated in the saddle, it will
find the pedal quite naturally, in fact the pedal
will come round to the foot. In dismounting as
in mounting, the rider should learn to do it with
equal ease and confidence from either side.
When the pedal is coming upward, throw the
weight upon it&mdash;this stops the momentum of
the machine&mdash;at the same time rising out of the
saddle, then pass the other foot over the cycle
and step down in front of the pedal, on which
the weight of the body is resting. A firm grasp
should be kept on both handles, and the machine
inclined towards the rider, on the side she dismounts.</p>

<p><i>The rule of the road</i> is usually ignored by cycling
women, but nothing in connection with the pastime
is really more important. To observe it
always whether necessary or not, is to reduce the
possibility of accident to a minimum. It then
becomes a habit, and in an emergency the instinct
is to do the right thing immediately, the
value of which can scarcely be over-estimated.
Always ride then to the left side of the road,
whether there are vehicles about or not. Remember,
it is the unexpected that always happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and should a cart or cycle suddenly appear from
a bye road, an accident will almost surely happen
if you are on the side that should be free for
them. If in spite of your caution an accident
happens, you will at least have the chance of
being compensated if you can prove that you
were on your proper side at the time; you certainly
would not, if you were on the wrong side.
There are only two occasions on which this rule
is deviated from, viz.: when passing a vehicle
which is going in the same direction or when
passing a led horse going in either direction.
When overtaking a vehicle, never pass between
it and the pavement or side-walk, for the tendency
is for the driver to pull in toward the left when
he hears anything behind him. With a led
horse the custom is to keep the man in charge
always <i>between</i> oneself and the led horse, no matter
in which part of the road the latter may be.
The reason is obvious, led horses being sometimes
playful with their heels.</p>

<p>The most fruitful cause of accidents is the
wrong taking of corners. The right way to do
it, however, is very simple. Thus if proceeding
along a road, and desiring to turn off to the left,
make the curve (if possible) in the road you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in, and thus enter the other road on the left, <i>i.e.</i>,
safe side. Remember
that
you cannot see
what is in the
other road, and
the act of turning
will make
the machine
swing out more or less from the proper side
(Fig. 5).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/illus-275a.jpg" width="392" height="254" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 5.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The principle is reversed when taking a turn
to the right.
Never cut across
the nearest corner
in doing this.
Go nearly across
the side road so
as to turn into it
on your proper
side thus (Fig. 6).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/illus-275b.jpg" width="337" height="240" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 6.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>If these simple matters are borne in mind, a
cyclist may go many years without even the risk
of an accident. Another thing to remember, is
never on any account to lose control of your
machine when descending a hill you do not know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
if the bottom of it cannot be seen. Though to
"fly" a hill is the height of enjoyment, safety
demands that the end of the spin should be
visible, or that you should know your ground
thoroughly.</p>

<p>In the choice of a machine, remember it is very
essential to have a cycle well suited to the rider.
Cyclists of experience get to know their own requirements
exactly and can suit their physical
peculiarities, but more often than not the beginner
is entirely in the hands of the cycle agent. Hence
we so often see a slight, frail woman struggling
along with a great, heavy unwieldy machine altogether
beyond her strength, or on the other
hand a heavy woman who is obviously under-mounted.
For riders who are of moderate height
or even a little over I believe in 26-inch wheels,
but tall women should have 28-inch wheels
fitted to their machines, to look proportionate to
the extra high frame necessary. In the latter
case everything else should be also larger. The
26-inch wheels look well for all but very tall or
stout riders. The usual height of frame is about
21 inches measured from the top of the frame&mdash;the
part where the seat pillar is fixed in&mdash;to the
centre of the bracket axle (Fig. 7). This will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
accommodate riders whose length of leg-reach is
up to 32 inches or 33 inches. It is better on the
whole to have the frame too short than too long.
It is more rigid if short, and a little seat pillar
standing out will not detract greatly from the
appearance. Always ascertain that there is a
margin of at least six inches between the height
of the seat pillar, when down at the lowest point,
and when raised to the fullest height at which it
can be safely fixed. Exactly the same should
apply to the stem of the handle bars, as, if the
saddle is raised the handles should be raised to a
corresponding degree, otherwise the rider will be
in a stooping position. The exact position of the
handles depends a great deal on the length of arm
and length of body of the rider, but in the ordinary
way the lowest part of the handles should be
at least two inches above the saddle (see Fig. 7),
as it is above all things necessary that the rider
shall not have to stoop forward when riding. On
the other hand, the handles must not be higher
than is necessary for a comfortable grasp, otherwise
the effect will be extremely ungraceful. As
the rider sits in the saddle with her arms extended
straight downward, she should be able to
swing them forward exactly into the riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
position, without bending the elbow in any appreciable
degree.</p>

<p>In purchasing a cycle the most important
points for the rider to consider are:</p>

<p>1. Rigidity of frame.</p>

<p>2. Weight.</p>

<p>3. Width of tread.</p>

<p>4. Height of pedal from the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 663px;">
<img src="images/illus-278.jpg" width="663" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. 7.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Rigidity of frame means speed, <i>i.e.</i>, ease of propulsion.
If the frame is badly designed it will
yield sideways to the rider's pressure, and much
of the power which would be otherwise used to
send it forward will be wasted. If you grasp the
steering head and the down tube of a cycle (see
Fig. 7) and endeavour to twist the frame, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
can ascertain whether it is rigid or not. It should
not be possible to force these two points towards
each other at all, or to pull them sideways out of
line with each other. If you can, there will be
no chance of riding up a steep incline on <i>that</i>
machine! There is another essential matter on
which the purchaser can protect herself. This
is to see that the cycle is properly stayed in various
parts of the frame. These "stays" bind the
whole frame firmly together and prevent "give"
or yielding, when pressure is applied on the
pedals. In addition to the "stays" in the front
portion of frame (examples of which are shown
in Fig. 7) there should be a stay between the
two back legs, just above the back wheel.</p>

<p>If you are purchasing a machine with an acknowledged
reputation, and made by a maker of
standing, it can safely be assumed that these matters
have been provided for, as they would only
be omitted on the score of cheapness. Never on
any account be persuaded to ride a machine
which is not fully guaranteed by a well-known
firm. There are so many points on which a
cycle may be faulty, and the only safeguard to the
rider is that the work shall have been carried out
in the most careful and conscientious fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
throughout. Therefore I would repeat never
trust yourself on any but a machine by a good
maker. Far better buy even a good second-hand
cycle than a "cheap" new one, for the latter may
cause constant trouble, to say nothing of the possibility
of serious accident.</p>

<p>The weight of an ordinary good-class ladies'
machine should not be over 30-lbs. It is possible
to obtain them fully equipped at about 28-lbs.,
but to get them at this or less either the weight
of the tyres, etc., have to be very much reduced,
or the fittings are not efficient. If the tyres are
very thin and light they will be constantly puncturing.
The gear case too should be of sufficient
stability, and the same remark applies to the dress-guards
and mud-guards; in fact it is in the fittings
that the weight of a cycle is found, the actual
frame not weighing more than 5-lbs. as a rule.
This is the reason why American machines are
lighter than English, the simple explanation being
that the former are fitted with the flimsiest of
chain covers, mud-guard, brake work, etc., whilst
the English-made cycle is properly equipped for
use in all weathers.</p>

<p>The width of "tread" is important, as both for
comfort and speed and also on the score of appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ance,
the rider's feet should not be wider apart
than is absolutely necessary. A narrow "tread"
is the sign of a well designed machine. To measure
this, the distance should be ascertained between
the inside faces of the two cranks, and this
distance should not be above five inches.</p>

<p>The height of the pedals from the ground is a
point which is never overlooked by a really good
firm of cycle makers. It is desirable to get the
pedals as near to the ground as possible for comfort
in mounting and for ease of propulsion; but
there is a limit, as if too low, the pedal would be
likely to catch the ground when the machine
leans over on a sharp corner. The consequence
of this would be disastrous to the rider. There
is also the lesser danger of the pedal striking a
stone if too near the ground. The usual distance
is about ten or ten-and-a-half inches from the
centre of bracket-axle to the ground.</p>

<p>Suitable clothing is as necessary in cycling as
in all other forms of exercise. Warmth with
lightness are the things to be aimed at, while
it is of the first necessity that there should
be no pressure anywhere, from the crown of
the head to the soles of the feet, to impede
free circulation. Having said this, little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
remains to add, as each rider will naturally have
her own ideas as to the underclothing she prefers,
and provided this is warm enough to guard the
wearer against chills and sufficiently light to prevent
it adding to her fatigue, I do not think it
much signifies what she chooses. Silk or woollen
knickerbockers of some dark colour should of
course be worn, and these which should be cut
fairly full must on no account be made of very
heavy material, a warm flannel lining being sufficient
in any case to give warmth.</p>

<p>A loosely-fitting bodice, or nicely-cut coat,
according to the time of year, will be found suitable,
and this brings me to the part of our attire
about which there is a real difficulty, namely, a
well cut skirt. Of all the many so-called cycling
"skirts," there are but few really suitable for the
purpose, for not only is it necessary they should
be useful, but it is on the way they fall that the
graceful or other appearance of the rider will
greatly depend. A woman may sit well and
pedal to perfection, but if she has a skirt that
does not hang evenly and easily on each side of
her saddle, and is of the right length, she will
not look well in motion.</p>

<p>The great difficulty is of course to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
"hang" right beside the saddle, and to ensure
the fulness keeping it its proper place, I have
originated a method for my own skirts which
I have found answer well. This is very simple,
and consists of a V shaped piece of the material
of which the skirt is made being firmly stitched
on below the band at the back, to hold the pleats
in place. With this, the fulness does not move
too easily to one side, when the necessary touch
to the skirt is made in mounting.</p>

<p>The skirt should be cut slightly longer behind
than in front, as of course when the rider is in
the saddle it will hang shorter than where it falls
straight down. When the wearer is standing up,
the skirt should come to within six inches of the
ground in front. As regards width, it should not
be too full, as nothing looks more ungraceful than
a skirt which flies out on either side with every
turn of the foot. At the same time it must be full
enough to allow complete freedom of movement.
About three-and-a-half yards is generally considered
the right width. When having a skirt
made from a new pattern, I should always insist on
having it fitted when you are seated in the saddle,
as only so can you tell how it will really answer.</p>

<p>For keeping the skirt from blowing up, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
found nothing better than to pass the feet through
a strap of &frac14;-inch elastic, about nine inches in
length, laid flat against the inside of the hem.
These straps should be placed about ten inches
on either side of the middle of front of skirt, so
as to enable you to walk without inconvenience.</p>

<p>As a material, a light woollen cloth of dark
and unobtrusive colour is in my opinion the most
suitable.</p>

<p>For riding you should have a hat that will
not catch the wind, and as shade for a part of the
year is desirable, you will find nothing better
than a "sailor" as a fitting accompaniment to a
sensible and workmanlike dress. A common
mistake is to have a heavy hat with a great deal
of trimming, which cannot be comfortable during
rapid motion through any but the stillest of
atmospheres.</p>

<p>As to foot-gear, a low-heeled flexible waisted
shoe is to be recommended, with gaiters for
winter wear.</p>

<p>An important matter for all and especially for
the delicate in health, who may so often derive
benefit from cycling, is to guard against a chill
after riding. No time should be lost after reaching
home, before putting on a complete set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
dry underclothing. It is by standing about,
perhaps out of doors or in a draught, till the
warm glow which was upon you when you
stepped off your machine has given place to a
shivery feeling, that you will get harm instead of
good from your pleasant spin, whereas a warm
bath and a fresh set of clothing, and not even the
most delicate need suffer from her exertions. If
you should for any reason not find this possible
without a certain delay, then put on a warm coat
or other wrap immediately, and this will generally
prevent you from suffering any ill effects.</p>

<p>You should always have your cycle dusted
over and any mud carefully wiped off, directly
you return from a ride. To prevent damage to
the enamel, the mud should be wiped very gently
with a soft wet cloth, and if this is carefully done
it does not matter whether the mud has dried or
not. The bright parts should be rubbed with a
soft leather or "selvyt," and then a Holland cover
be thrown over the machine, to keep it free from
dust or any slight damp. With the exception
of a rub with the "selvyt" the cycle will then
be ready for use. If a slight application of a
good furniture cream is made to the enamelled
parts, it will brighten them considerably. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
it is known that the machine will not be required
for any length of time, all the bright parts should
be smeared with Vaseline, and the machine itself
should be stood in a dry place. It is best to rest
it on a small stand, which is also very useful for
cleaning purposes. After a long rest all the
bearings should be well oiled, the lamp refilled,
and the machine generally overhauled. The
tyres should be kept hard. Some people let the
air out when their machine is not in use, under
the idea that it is good for the tyres, but this is
a mistake. If the tyres are allowed to go flat,
the weight of the machine will be likely to
"nip" the inner tube. Above all, oil should be
kept from the tyres, and if any should by chance
drop on them while the machine is being oiled,
it should be carefully wiped off. A tyre should
not need blowing up, more than once in two or
three weeks, if the valves are in good order. If,
therefore, it should require inflating every day,
as sometimes happens, either there is a small
puncture, or the valve is out of order. If the
trouble is caused by a puncture, it will generally
mean a visit to the repairers, but first examine
the valves in case these should be at fault, for
very often a little attention to them will put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
matters right. As there are so many kinds of
valves a technical illustration would be of little
use, but as a rule all valves can be unscrewed and
examined easily. In the valve most in use, viz.:
that of the Dunlop tyre, if the end is unscrewed&mdash;after
the dust cap is taken off&mdash;the whole
mechanism of the valve can be taken out, and
this will be found to consist only of a small
cylinder covered by a little indiarubber tube.
This piece of rubber covers the valve hole in the
cylinder, and it is the rubber which generally
wants replacing. The dust cap is the small cap,
attached by a little chain to the spokes, and
which is screwed over the end of the valve to
keep the dirt out, after the tyre has been inflated.</p>

<p>If the rider does not object to a little trouble,
a puncture can be repaired at home, though the
chief objection to the operation is the dirty state
in which it is apt to get the operator, unless
indeed the tyres are thoroughly cleaned first.
When you buy a machine, the exact details are
given with each particular class of tyre, and
general instructions for repairing will be found
included in the repair-outfit, which can be purchased
for about sixpence. This tyre-outfit consists
of a small quantity of solution&mdash;which be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
careful not to get on the fingers&mdash;some rubber
patches, and French chalk. When the inner
tube has been taken off, the valve should be
refitted to it, and the tubes inflated. Then pass
the tube through water, using a shallow bowl for
the purpose. From each spot where there is a
puncture, little air bubbles will come out whilst
the tube is under water. Mark these with a
pencil, let the air out&mdash;by the valve&mdash;and dry
the tube. Then with a piece of glass paper,
clean the tube from sulphur&mdash;till the natural
dark colour of the rubber appears&mdash;where the
puncture is, say for a space as large as a sixpence.
Put some solution thinly on the rubber patch, let
it nearly dry, and then press it down on the tube,
on the spot cleaned from sulphur, and hold it
there for a minute or two. The puncture of
course will be in the centre of this spot if you
have managed properly. A little French chalk
dusted over the patch will prevent any solution
there may be round the patch, from sticking to
the outer cover when the tyre is put together
again.</p>

<p>With regard to the general adjustment of a
cycle, it is most essential that all the bearing
parts should be in proper order, as any one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
them will make a very great difference in labour
to the rider. A few brief notes on the principal
parts will enable the rider to ascertain if her
mount is in proper condition to do justice to her
own riding powers. First the chain. This
should be oiled occasionally in its whole length,
so that each joint is properly lubricated. When
it has been oiled along the top half, the wheels
should be revolved sufficiently to bring the other
half on top for oiling. The chain must not be
too tight, or the machine will be hard to drive,
neither must it be too loose, or accidents will
occur. The state of the chain can be ascertained
by taking hold of one pedal, whilst the machine
is at rest with its weight on the ground. The
pedal and crank should just show the slightest
perceptible movement, without moving the
machine, if the chain is in good order. The
pedals should revolve twenty or thirty times at
least, when given a good sharp spin with the
hand, and there should be no perceptible shake
in them. The steering is a very important point,
as if this is stiff it will increase the labour in
riding. If the front wheel is lifted from the
ground, its own weight should make it drop over
to one side or the other, which ever way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
machine lies, else the steering is too stiff for easy
riding. There should be no shake whatever in
the steering, the front wheel, when tested, should
be immoveable from the rest of the machine,
either backwards or forwards. All the bearings
require a moderate oiling for about every fifty
miles you ride. Olive or other clear oil is used
for lubricating the bearings, and on no account
must paraffin or a similar oil be used, except for
<i>cleaning</i> the bearings out. Most cycle dep&ocirc;ts
supply a suitable oil for lubricating. Once or
twice in the year it is advisable to run paraffin
through the bearings, but care must be taken to
drain it all out afterwards, and the bearings should
then be oiled with proper lubricant. Sperm or
colza oil is good for burning in the lamp. Add
a small piece of camphor to this to give a clearer
light. A little paraffin may be put on the top
of the wick at the burner, to make the lamp
light easily, but if this is added to the burning
oil, the lamp will smoke, and be liable to jolt out
over rough places. If the machine is properly
adjusted and well oiled, the wheels should&mdash;after
being revolved&mdash;swing back and forth once or
twice with their own weight. At the same time,
no "shake" should be discernible sideways, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the wheels should appear to be a rigid part of the
machine.</p>

<p>A very useful aid to wheel-women is the <i>Cyclists' Pocket Book</i>.
Most portable and well printed, it contains all kinds of useful information

<h2><a name="FANCY_FIGURES_AND_MUSICAL" id="FANCY_FIGURES_AND_MUSICAL">FANCY FIGURES AND MUSICAL
RIDES.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-295.jpg" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> branch of Cycling familiarly
known as "figure riding" is open to
all, and there is no doubt that the
short turns and rapid curves required
are not only fascinating, but at the same time
excellent practice. The control over the machine
given by them will enable the rider to pick his
or her way very exactly through the most difficult
pathway. Some may laugh at the idea of
"riding to music," but having once tried it you
will find they are generally glad to do it again.
The figures, varied as they are, and presenting
almost endless possibilities, are intricate enough to
give a beginner in this branch of the art, absorbing
work, and even afterwards, when perfection has
been attained, there will be found a charm in
winding in and out in the execution of the
figures, so long as everyone engaged in the ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
keeps time. For it must not be forgotten that it
is in the neatness and precision with which they
are done that the fascination exists.</p>

<p>It was while staying at an hotel in the country
that a rainy day drove me to the nearest Gymnasium
to try Cycling for the first time. As it
happened, the instructors were accustomed to put
up clubs and teach their pupils to circle round
them so as to ensure balance and absolute control
over their machines. I believe it was by accident
that they first tried riding to music, but once
tried it was never abandoned, as it was found an
enormous help in keeping a regular pace, and in
enabling the leader to guide the ride more accurately.
Nothing but a waltz, however, will be
found suitable. In the summer, shortly after
this, I first turned figure riding to account, as a
means of amusing my guests, and I found it so
popular that eventually I procured the services of
an instructor, and we used to ride every afternoon.</p>

<p>It is surprising how many miles one goes,
simply turning and twisting, and going over the
same ground. With tea spread near by, and comfortably
seated in easy chairs, placed so as to command
a view of the riding, even the onlookers, I
found, were well amused, and for those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
wish to spend a delightful summer's afternoon
in an exercise, combining sociability and amusement,
I know of no better pastime than this.</p>

<p>There are a few simple rules to be attended to,
which it may not be amiss for me to state, and
then by the aid of some diagrams I hope to give
the key to what may look difficult, though, in
reality, it is easy enough.</p>

<p>1. In the first place either a Gymnasium or
smooth lawn must be selected to ride on. In
the latter case it will not hurt the grass, no matter
what your gardener may say to the contrary,
and if he will only water it and roll it daily, or
even twice a day, you will have a delightful
ground, and in the following year an even better
grass crop than if it had not been so treated.</p>

<p>2. The lawn should be the size that is usually
allotted to a full size Croquet lawn. However,
there is no rule as to size, though with a
greater number of riders, you will have to go
over a larger space. I, therefore, recommend a
fairly large ground, especially as after rain the
grass is apt to become slippery, and even in those
rides which are done by only four riders you will
have to make larger circles to avoid accidents.</p>

<p>3. Never attempt to do the rides too quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Sacrifice speed to exactitude when necessary, and
pay great attention to making all your turns simultaneously.</p>

<p>4. If a mistake is made in a figure, dismount
and begin again. In some of the rides if one
person makes an error, she can <i>ride to the side</i> and
dismount, while the others continue, but in most
cases this will put the ride out, and it is better
for all to stop. In any case no one should ever
try to cut in and resume her original place or join
in a ride after it has begun.</p>

<p>When possible, it is best to have someone on
foot who will give the word of command, for
this is a great help, not only to the leaders but to
all who are riding.</p>

<p>Before mounting or dismounting, have the order
given to do so very distinctly, and make it a
never-failing rule <i>never</i> to let the riders be taken
by surprise. I think too, at a garden party, it is
always a good plan to let all who are going to
take part in the ride join in the first figure, as it
will make them feel more interest in the proceedings,
and give everyone time to become at ease
on their bicycles. For this purpose I would
suggest the "double snake" through clubs. (See
Fig. 1.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>For this you will begin with "single snake,"
by riding once round the lawn. Be sure that
everybody is in line when the word to mount is
given; it creates confusion and leads to unnecessary
collisions when several mount in a group.
Of course the pace must be regulated by the
leader. Starting at the corner below clubs C,
this rider will go round <i>outside</i> the clubs, and
having reached the point marked (*) will turn
in and ride straight between clubs A, then going
to the right between those marked B, and afterwards
through C. At the same place the turn
was made the first time it should be repeated,
and having passed between A turn to the left
through E and D. After repeating some four or
five times begin the "double snake."</p>

<p>Up to this point all have followed one leader,
now two will be required. Continue as before,
but when leader No. 1, after passing through
clubs A turns to the right to clubs C, leader No.
2 will turn to the left between E and D. The
third rider will then follow No. 1 and the fourth
No. 2, each keeping her original distance, for
when leader No. 1, having passed clubs C turns
through A again, No. 2 will fall in behind, and
the same with all the others, each resuming her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
original place. The next time No. 1 will turn
to the left, No. 2 to the right, each leader being
followed by half the riders, dividing alternately.
To finish the ride all will follow leader No. 1,
and having again been the round of the lawn
should dismount <i>together</i>. To add to the effect
it is most important that this should be done in
line and simultaneously. Although exceedingly
easy, when done with care and in time with the
music, this is a very pretty ride.</p>

<p>The next ride is commonly called "Centre
Circles." This cannot be done by more than
four. Each rider will start from her own corner,
and while riding separately should remember that
No. 1 <i>always</i> regulates the pace, and the others
must keep in time with her. The proper distances
should be kept in the ride round the
ground, and then No. 1 having come abreast of
club E, No. 2 abreast of club D, No. 3 with club
C, and No. 4 with club B, at the word "circle"
all will circle to the left, making a semi-circle,
and when abreast of club A circling that <i>fully</i>,
and branching off when No. 1 is again beside
club C, which she encircles. Thus: As No. 1
goes round her club (E) the others will circle
theirs, and as all are doing the same figure at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
same time the four will meet in the centre circle
(A), and when No. 1 turns off to circle club C,
No. 4, who began by circling club B, will go to
club D, and circle that, and No. 3 who began at
Club C will go to club E (for her second circle),
etc. This can be continued as long as desired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the riders No. 1 and No. 3 alternating between
clubs C and E, and the other two taking clubs
B and D. Each one, from her own starting
point, does exactly the figure as drawn in Figure
2.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/illus-301.jpg" width="420" height="547" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. III</i></p>

<p><i>Cross bows.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another ride, but requiring more accuracy
in time-keeping, is that known as "cross bows,"
and this is one of the prettiest of all, for the
whole of the lawn is occupied, and when done
by practised riders and rather quickly, it is
charming to watch and most fascinating to do.
Again four riders are required, and they mount
in line. The five clubs are in the same position
as for Centre Circles. In this ride, however,
there are two leaders, No. 1 being followed by
rider No. 3, and No. 2 by rider No. 4. As in
Figure 3, leader No. 1 will follow the <i>dotted</i> lines,
while leader No. 2 will go over the heavy lines
indicated; rider No. 3 following leader No. 1,
and rider No. 4 following leader No. 2. It is imperative
that the original distances be kept exactly,
or in crossing at points F and G there will
surely be a collision otherwise. This being a
complicated ride to do well, it will require practice,
but I think that by following the lines of
the diagram there will be no difficulty in learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
it. Leader No. 1 (having led the ride all round
the lawn) on reaching club B will ride straight
across to club D, keeping to the right of centre
club A, and turning round club D will then ride
straight back to club B again, followed by rider
3. At the same time leader 2, in starting the
ride, will turn short to her left, going outside
club E, where she begins the "cross bow," by
riding straight across the lawn to club C.
Leaders 1 and 2 should reach clubs D and E
simultaneously and turn them together, and leader
No. 1 making her curve closer to the club
than No. 2, should pass the point F on the diagram
just as No. 2 reaches it on her way to club
C. In this way rider 3 will pass point F immediately
after No. 2, and rider 4, following No.
2 will pass F a second after No. 3. Reaching
B, leader 1 will now make the double curve
round clubs B and E, as shown, and leader 2 will
do the same between C and D, and on reaching
B and C again, they will do once more the "cross
bow" as described, only this time leader 1 will
pass over point G first, and leader 2 will follow,
as was done before in passing F. The greatest
exactitude should be kept in crossing each other,
for not only does safety demand it, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
done with indecision and over zig-zag lines, the
figure loses its beauty, and like all the other rides,
becomes difficult to follow. It is fatal to any
ride to do it in a wavering way, which will impress
people with the idea that you are not sure
of it yourself. The best riders I have ever seen
doing these figures, have always emphasized the
straight lines, thus making their curves seem
more sweeping by contrast, and adding greatly
to the effect.</p>

<p>Another thing figure riders invariably advocate,
is to ride very high, and certainly once any
one has ridden with both handle-bars and seat
well up, they never can go back to the lower
saddle. Some people indeed say it is more difficult
to ride high, but I do not think when you
have become used to it, that you will find it so.
Of all things to be avoided I would mention the
mistake of putting up the handle bars, without
heightening the saddle. I heard this position
once described as that of "begging," and it has
always seemed to me irresistibly ludicrous ever
since. If you will watch the ankle play of two
riders, one with the saddle high and the other
with it low, you will not hesitate an instant as to
which position is preferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of rides you
can do. Almost any book of army drills, especially
for cavalry, will give you ideas for a hundred
new figures, and you can vary these, not the
least amusing part being in creating, adapting
and arranging figures to add to the old repertoire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/illus-305.jpg" width="437" height="567" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Fig. IV</i></p>

<p><i>American Circle ride.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>But to go back to the well-known figures, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
which one is never tired, and which always hold
their own as to prettiness.</p>

<p>Let us continue with the "American Circle
Ride." This can be ridden by any number and
is a great favourite when introduced at garden-parties.
With eight riders, three rows of three
clubs each are needed, and these rows should be
about three bicycle lengths from each other,
while two bicycle lengths should separate the
clubs in the rows. All the riders start in a line.
On reaching line B, leader 1 goes to the left of
Club 3, and No. 2 will keep to its right so that
they ride side by side, divided by the clubs. The
others divide in the same way and at the bottom
they will turn to their respective sides, leader No.
1 following line A, and leader No. 2 line C.
To begin with, they will <i>both</i> do the circles to
the left as drawn down line C, and meeting at
the top they again come down the centre on
either side of Clubs B, side by side. The second
time they both do the ride as shewn through
line A, doing the middle club the reverse way
to the first and last, and for the third round, reverting
to the ride as shown through Clubs C, only
of course, where those following leader 2 turn to
the left, those following No. 1 will turn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
circle to the right. In coming down the centre
the leaders can join hands, and the others naturally
will do the same, but this is generally called
by another name, and is often worked as another
figure.</p>

<p>Speaking of circling to left and right brings
up another very pretty figure for a number of
riders. Set your Clubs as for "Centre Circles"
and begin (all following one leader) by circling
Club B, going right round it as shown in Figure
2, and going on to E, then D, and finally to C,
then describe the double curve as shown in
'cross bows' (between Clubs B and E of Figure
3) only ride straight round Club D&mdash;Figure 2.
The Club marked E in the former, is D in
Figure 2. Having gone round Club D, go on
to Club E, and circle that to the right, and then
on to B, and so circle every club as you come to
it. Having circled D again, to finish the ride,
go to Club C passing outside it, and then straight
round the lawn. This can be done by two
parties at the same time, one starting from Club
B, the other from Club D, and each doing the
same thing at opposite corner Clubs throughout
the ride. I have seen as many as twenty riding
in this figure together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Maypole" is of course very pretty and
when care is taken to ensure the riders having
ribbons to match the colour they wear, or in
which they have decked their bicycles, it is
lovely. It is simple to execute, too, and can be
done by almost any number, though I think eight
or ten quite enough. Half the riders will go to
the left, the other half to the right. Supposing
the pole to be in the centre of the lawn, the four
who are going to the right will mount at the
four points of the compass, holding their ribbons
high above them, in their right hands. The
other four will mount, a little farther from the
pole, as they will make a larger circle to begin
with, and hold their ribbons in their left hands
as they go to the left. In order to weave a regular
pattern, those going to the left and right must
pass each other in and out, as they meet. It is
easier to learn the ride if Clubs are put up, where
the riders should meet and pass each other, as
they go in and out. There should be an even
number of riders and a club for each. If eight
were riding, four would pass the first club on the
left and the next on their right, and so on, while
the other half would pass their first Club on the
right and the second club to the left. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
found easier to keep your balance if you hold
your arm high, and there is no doubt that it looks
better.</p>

<p>The idea of passing clubs first on the right and
then on the left alternately has been the foundation
of a number of rides. A pretty sight is to
have a circle of clubs, with a rider to each. One
rider will begin by going outside the circle, from
inside, and passing between the clubs at the same
time that the next rider will pass from outside
into the circle, and so picking their way to the
left of one club and the right of the next, all
the way round the ring. However, all depends
on the riders passing the clubs at the same moment
on their several ways, and as this requires
no little practice to do well, one rarely sees this
figure to advantage.</p>

<p>Fancy Figure Riding may sound tame to those
who have never tried it, but I venture to think
that those who once take to it will very quickly
become fascinated, and my own belief is, that as
figures become better known, and more hostesses
introduce them at their gatherings, this branch
of cycling will increase in popularity.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Lawn-tennis</span>, though still in its
youth, may with some justice lay claim
through its prototypes, Longue paume,
Pallone, Tennis, etc., to an illustrious
ancestry; the connection between the modern and
the older games being sufficient to establish a relationship.
It is not necessary here to trace this
connection step by step, beginning perchance with
the game which Louis X. of France played in the
forest of Vincennes to the championship fought
out on the Wimbledon Club grounds in 1897.
The greater part of such a history would of necessity
belong to tennis proper, which, as we
know, has been a popular English game for many
ages. So in the 15th century we hear of a tennis
court at Windsor Castle, and the present one at
Hampton Court was originally built by Henry
VIII., in whose reign it was that Sir Thomas
More, in his "Utopia," stigmatised tennis along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
with "dice, cards, tables, bowls and quoits" as
"a naughty and unlawful game."</p>

<p>The first authentic record we have of lawn-tennis
as we know it dates back no further than
1874, when Major Wingfield patented a certain
pastime by him named "Sphairistike." It was
not I believe claimed to be an invention, but
merely an adaptation of a sport almost as old as
the world itself. A sub-committee of the Marylebone
Cricket Club was asked in 1875 to bring
order into chaos, everyone for the twelve months
of its existence having chosen to play "Sphairistike,"
or lawn-tennis, as it was now called, as it
best pleased them. A code was drawn up, issued
and quickly superseded, but at least there was a
recognised length and breadth of court and height
of net, which prior to this, as I have said, depended
entirely upon the taste of the players.
In 1875 lawn-tennis took up its headquarters at
Wimbledon, being admitted to form part of the
"All England Croquet Club" there. The game
was introduced at Prince's Club in the same year.
In 1876 tennis scoring was adopted, and it was
the general opinion that lawn-tennis had come to
stay. In the following year the "All England
Croquet Club" determined to include the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of the new game in its title, and it became
known as the "All England Croquet and Lawn-Tennis
Club." In another twelve or eighteen
months the visitor had pushed the host out of
house and home, the club becoming henceforth
headquarters of lawn-tennis alone.</p>

<p>It was in the July of 1877 that the first lawn-tennis
championship meeting was held at Wimbledon,
a silver challenge cup being offered for
competition by the proprietors of <i>The Field</i>.
There were twenty-two entries, Mr. Spencer-Gore
carrying off the championship and the all-comers
prizes. The principal results of the first tournament
was to show up a serious defect, viz.: the
great preponderance of games won by the server
against those gained by the striker-out; the proportion
being about five to three. This defect was
remedied in 1878 by bringing the service line four
feet nearer the net, from twenty-six feet to twenty-two
feet. The net at the same time was lowered
from five feet at the posts to four feet nine inches,
and from three feet three inches at the centre to
three feet. In 1879 two more championships
were instituted, those of the Oxford University
Lawn-Tennis Club, and of Ireland. The latter
meeting was of particular importance to lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
players, owing to the fact that it was their first
competition ground. This pioneer of women's
lawn-tennis championships was carried off by
Miss M. Langrishe, who was also successful in
securing the Irish prize in 1883 and 1886. The
first occasion on which ladies competed at Wimbledon
was in the year 1884, when Miss M.
Watson secured the All England Championship,
to which she joined the double victory of Ireland,
where she defeated Miss M. Langrishe.</p>

<p>In 1885 the manager of the Buxton Tournament
instituted a ladies' double championship,
carried off by Mrs. Watts and Miss Bracewell.
The championship of England and Ireland was
again held by Miss M. Watson. It was during
this year that Miss L. Dod first began to be
known in the front ranks of lady players, though
it was not until 1887 that she held the championship
of England and Ireland, since when she has
held the English Championship four times. In
1886 Miss Bingley, now Mrs. Hillyard, shot to
the fore, defeating Miss Watson at Wimbledon.
Her victory, though coming as something of a
surprise, was magnificently earned, her extreme
accuracy and power creating a good deal of enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The next epoch of importance in ladies' tennis&mdash;and
the last possible variation of the game&mdash;was
the institution, in 1888, of the "All England
Mixed Doubles Championship," won by Mr. E.
Renshaw and Mrs. Hillyard. During the same
year the "Lawn-Tennis Association" came into
existence, the want having for long been felt of
one recognised authority, under whose rules all
championship matches should be played. In
1890, the Association made important alterations
in some of the previously recognised laws. The
change of sides under the new <i>regime</i> was fixed
at the end of the first, third and every alternate
game of the set, instead of at the end of each
game. Bisques were abolished, and the quarter
system of receiving odds was instituted, more of
which hereafter. Subsequently the distance of
the service line from the net was fixed at 21-ft.,
and the height of the net at 3-ft. 6-in. at the
posts, and 3-ft. at the centre.</p>

<p>The strides made in lawn-tennis since its first
institution as a game are remarkable indeed,
when we consider that the first and only tournament
in the land was held in 1877, and that in
1897, the list of tournament dates issued by the
Lawn-Tennis Association comprised sixty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
fixtures in the United Kingdom, and seven on
the Continent. I must not forget to add that in
1885, the first Covered Court Championship was
held, Mr. Lawford carrying off the prize. The
Ladies' Covered Court Championship was not
inaugurated till 1890, when Miss Jacks secured
the coveted title, Miss Austin being the holder
in 1897.</p>

<p>The Ladies' Championship of 1897, was very
closely contested, Mrs. Hillyard playing Miss C.
Cooper (the holder). The first set was won by
the latter lady, but owing to the severity of Mrs.
Hillyard's returns, Miss Cooper was unable to
maintain her advantage and was finally beaten,
the sets standing at 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Mrs. Hillyard
also carried off the Ladies' Singles, defeating Mrs.
Pickering by two sets to love&mdash;6-2, 7-5. The
Irish Championship was also gained by the Wimbledon
victor, who beat the Irish candidate, Miss
Dyas, by two sets to one&mdash;7-5, 2-6, 6-3,&mdash;thus
proving herself the best lady player of the year.</p>

<p>With many lawn-tennis players the choice of
a court is unfortunately apt to exemplify the old
saying that "the coat must be cut according to
the cloth," though in these days of plenty when
every town in the United Kingdom possesses at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
least one lawn-tennis club, it should not be so
difficult to secure the best advantages for practice.
It is a different matter of course with a
private court, the formation of which may, for
many reasons be a difficult task; though the advantages
of a ground upon the premises is too
obvious to need demonstration. In the first place
the court should be chosen lengthways from N.
to S., to provide for obtaining the best possible
light; secondly, if the process of levelling cannot
be indulged in, let the ground chosen be at
least as level as possible; and thirdly, let my
foregoing remark apply equally to drainage.
The absence of any obstacles such as overhanging
branches, or the too close proximity of shrubs, is
also to be carefully thought of, and avoided.
An ample margin all round being allowed for,
according to the first "recommendation" in the
handbook of the Lawn-Tennis Association.
"There should be, if possible, a clear margin of
at least 12-ft. on each side, and 21-ft. at each
end of the court."</p>

<p>The preparation of the court should be, as far
as possible, the player's individual care. Even
when the turf is coarse or weed grown to begin
with, the careful application of a mowing ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>chine,
a roller and a knife, will soon work wonders.
Should plantains prevail, cut them off
close to the soil, whenever they appear&mdash;I have
known a promising court spoilt by an attempt to
dig these weeds out, root and all, with the result
that when play commenced, the balls shot at
obtuse and unexpected angles. The mowing
machine and the roller must be kept in constant
use, the former should do its work every day if
necessary, after the grass has finished growing,
during the process once a week will be sufficient&mdash;this,
perhaps, is more applicable when grass
has been <i>sown</i>. Old turf should never be allowed
to look even slightly ragged. The energetic use
of a roller helps the grass roots to spread out and
obtain the mastery over the decapitated weeds.</p>

<p>I quote from the Lawn-Tennis Association
handbook for the dimensions of the court.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Law 1.</i> "For the single-handed game, the court
is 27-ft. in width, and 78-ft. in length. It is
divided across the middle with a net, the ends
of which are attached to two posts, which
stand 3-ft. outside the court on each side. The
height of the net is 3-ft. 6-in. at the posts, and
3-ft. at the centre. At each end of the court,
parallel with the net, and at a distance of 39-ft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
from it, are drawn the <i>base-lines</i>, the extremities
of which are connected by the <i>side-lines</i>.
Half-way between the side-lines and parallel
with them, is drawn the <i>half-court-line</i>, dividing
the space on each side of the net into two
equal parts, and called the <i>right and left courts</i>.
On each side of the net, at a distance of 21-ft.
from it, and parallel with it, are drawn the
<i>service-lines</i>."</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/illus-321a.jpg" width="474" height="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Single Court.</i></p>

<p><i>78 feet.</i></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">
<img src="images/illus-321b.jpg" width="479" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Double Court.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>When a double court is required, the base-lines
must be prolonged 4-ft. 6-in. in each direc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>tion,
when by joining the four new points, the
side-lines of a double court are obtained; it will
not now be necessary to prolong the inner side-lines
further than the service lines.</p>

<p>The measuring of a court is always apt to be
tedious work, but with a little method, a measuring
tape, a reel of stout string, some small
wooden pegs and a fair supply of patience, the
difficulties are soon overcome. The first necessity
is to fix the posts in position&mdash;I have always
found it simplified matters to represent the net
by a piece of string from post to post&mdash;then
measure off a distance of 3-ft. from each, inwards
of course. From the point now obtained, measure
the side-lines, 78-ft. which gives us 39-ft. each
way from the posts. From the side-lines now
measure 4&frac12;-ft. inwards, and 21-ft. each way from
the net string for the service-lines. It now only
remains for these lines to be joined along their
base by four others running parallel with the net,
two on each side of it, respectively termed the
base-lines and the service-lines. Half-way between
the service-lines and parallel with the side-lines,
a line is next drawn to form the half-court-line,
which accomplishes the task. Each point
as it is measured should be marked off with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
peg; then when all the dimensions are taken, a
piece of string should be pulled taut from peg to
peg, serving as guide to the marker. As a last
word on the subject, I may say that I have never
heard a low price in markers, nets, posts, or
indeed in any implement of the game, recommended
as being really economical.</p>

<p>As to balls they can be obtained in many
makes, but "Ayre's Championship" stand first
in the list of excellence. By the laws of the
Lawn Tennis Association the weight of a ball
shall be not less than 1-1/8-oz., or more than 2-oz.
In 1877, the year of the first Championship, the
minimum weight was 1&frac14;-oz., and the maximum
1&frac12;-oz.</p>

<p><i>The Racket.</i> On the fortunate choice of a
racket, depends literally at least half the success
or failure of any battle fought with it. Writing
of rackets, Mr. C. A. Heathcote says: "The
essential points are&mdash;a good hoop, free from
knots, with a well-marked and continuous grain,
plain wooden handle, round or slightly octagonal,
fitting the hand of the player, attached to the
middle piece without any perceptible interval,
and good strong gut."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is an essential point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
that the racket should not be too heavy; on the
other hand an over-light racket is far from desirable,
except perhaps for a volleying game. From
12 to 13-oz. is usually considered a good weight
range for a lady's racket, though I have frequently
met with ladies who never touched anything
under 14-oz. Indeed, in a matter of this sort,
the choice must rest very much with the player
herself, who will soon find from experience what
weight suits her best. And so long as she confines
her selection to the first makes, she cannot
go very far wrong.</p>

<p><i>Scoring.</i> The only satisfactory manner in which
lawn-tennis scoring can be dealt with on paper,
is by quoting once more from the laws of the
Lawn-Tennis Association, thus:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Law 21.</i> On either player winning his first
stroke, the score is called 15 for that player,
on either player winning his second stroke, the
score is called 30 for that player; on either
player winning his third stroke, the score is
called 40 for that player; and the fourth stroke
won by either player is scored game for that
player, except as below:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If both players have won three strokes, the
score is called deuce, and the next stroke won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
by either player is called advantage for that
player. If the same player win the next stroke,
he wins the game; if he lose the next stroke
the score is again called deuce, and so on
until either player win the two strokes immediately
following the score at deuce, when the
game is scored for that player.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Law 22.</i> The player who first wins six games
wins a set, except as below:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If both players win five games, the score is
called games-all, and the next game won by
either player is scored advantage-game for that
player. If the same player win the next game,
he wins the set; if he lose the next game, the
score is again called games-all; and so on until
either player wins the two games immediately
following the score of games-all, when he wins
the set.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Note.</i> Players may agree not to play advantage
sets, but to decide the set by one game
after arriving at the score of games-all.</p></div>

<p><i>Odds.</i> In the year 1888, bisques&mdash;which had
been borrowed from tennis&mdash;were abolished. A
bisque is one stroke which may be claimed at
any time during a set. The principal disadvantage
of this system lay in the difficulty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
employing it judiciously, thereby causing a certain
mental strain, possibly injurious to the
player's form. The bisque gave place to the
"quarter" and the "perfect" systems, which in
their turn were superseded by the "sixth system"
in 1894, now in universal use. Roughly, the
sixth system of handicapping is to receive odds of
one, two, three, four, or five strokes in every six
games of a set; each given stroke being respectively
described as one-sixth, two-sixths, three-sixths,
four-sixths, five-sixths, fifteen. For complete
and detailed tables of the system of handicapping,
the reader is referred to the handbook
of the Lawn-Tennis Association.</p>

<p><i>On the subject of suitable clothing</i> much might be
written. For any form of outdoor exercise, the
two chief requisites of costume are warmth and
lightness. A thin flannel shirt is more useful
than anything, worn with a <i>short</i> light skirt. I
have seen such terrible and distressing results
arise from the wearing of skirts which, though
short in front, dropped at the back that I cannot
too strongly emphasise the need for <i>all-round</i>
shortness; loss of temper and dignity being among
the lesser evils accruing from neglect of this particular.
The shoes worn should be strong and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a><br /><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a><br /><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>serviceable, usefulness never being allowed to give
way to the merely ornamental; but now-a-days
it is an easy matter to combine the two qualities.
For play in damp weather it is permissible to
wear shoes with a leather sole into which short
nails, known as steel points, are fitted. These
are allowed on all grounds. In the matter of
hats a straw sailor with a widish brim is the most
workmanlike form of head gear possible. It is
perhaps scarcely necessary to add that perfect
looseness of every garment is a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> for
the freedom of movement necessary in lawn-tennis.</p>

<p><i>UNDER-HAND SERVICE.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Good form is as much an essential in the pursuit
of any sport or pastime as it is in the manners
and usages of polite society, and the cultivation
of style is not an achievement purely confined to
the wayfarer in the paths of literature. In lawn-tennis,
as in everything else, a good beginning
makes a good noontide; and really, when one
comes to think about it, it is as easy to learn well
as badly. Therefore it is never advisable for a
beginner to be content with another beginner as
her opponent. No doubt a certain diffidence
may be felt by the inexperienced player in throwing
down the gauntlet to a more practised hand,
because of the lack of interest and excitement for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the latter in the game. But this consideration
should never be allowed to deter the seizing of
an opportunity of playing against an opponent
from whom something may be learnt. There
are plenty of good-natured people in the world,
and an ounce of practical demonstration, is worth
a ton's weight of written explanation as to the
different actions necessary for playing the varied
strokes, which go to compose the game of lawn-tennis.</p>

<p><i>Service.</i> Like everything else worth having, a
good service is extremely difficult to acquire. It
is always best to ascertain by experiment and
observation what particular style of service would
seem most within one's power of attainment, and
this style should be kept to. There is nothing
more detrimental to good play than indecision or
constant change of form. Experiments, though
doubtless necessary at first, should be discontinued
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The majority of ladies, for a variety of reasons,
prefer to serve underhand. Miss L. Dod, in her
able contribution in the <i>Badminton Library</i>, is of
the opinion that unless in exceptional cases, overhand
service tends merely to a waste of strength
without making the stroke more difficult to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
than the ordinary underhand service.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the
face of such competent authority it would be
fatuous to advance a contrary opinion; but if any
special aptitude is felt for the overhand service,
it will probably be found easier to practice with
success than the underhand.</p>

<p>The server should stand either in the middle
of the base-line, or a few feet to the right or left
of it, though she is at liberty to take up any position
on the base-line that she chooses. According
to Law 7 of the game: "The server should
stand with one foot beyond&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, further from the
net than&mdash;the base-line, and with the other foot
upon the base-line, and shall deliver the service
from the right and left courts alternately, beginning
from the right. This law is of great importance
and should never, even in the most ordinary
play, be disregarded. <i>For the underhand service</i>,
the body should be slightly bent and the racket
swung well up. I have seen the swing carried
high above the right shoulder, the ball being
dropped in front of the racket as it arrives near
the middle of the downward stroke (Fig. A).
<i>In the overhand service</i>, the body should be inclined
somewhat backward, and the racket brought well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
above the head (as in Fig. B) to obtain the utmost
possible reach. The ball is held somewhat below
the level of the left shoulder, and thrown gently
in front of the descending racket. Before a great
degree of swiftness is attempted in either of these
two services, accuracy should be ensured. In fact
a well-known saying might be profitably adapted
for the use of lawn-tennis players, both proficient
and non-proficient: "Take care of accuracy, and
brilliancy will take care of itself."</p>

<p>For the purpose of training the eye, it is no
bad device to place a ball on the spot where the
service is intended to drop and take aim at it.
The satisfaction of hitting the mark will not be
frequent, but the practice will at least impart
some idea of locality. In service when one fault
has already been made, it is wonderfully easy to
drop into the bad habit of sending an easy catch
to represent the second stroke; neither is this
reprehensible custom entirely confined to beginners
who might, perhaps, be excused for exercising
a certain amount of caution over their last
chance. Over and over again I have seen ladies,
who did not by any means count themselves
tyros, indulging in this defective style of play.
They appear to think that one ball either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
"smashed" into the net, or sent a dozen yards
out of court absolves them from further effort;
their second stroke being as harmfully innocuous
as their first was mistakenly vicious. And in
this case again, nothing but practice will give
equality. <i>To obtain a twist</i> the ball should be
struck first with the left side of the racket&mdash;which
will be held in a more horizontal position
than for the regular forward stroke&mdash;and as it
were run across its face, or in other words the
racket is twisted round the ball from right to
left.</p>

<p><i>To receive a service</i> the striker-out should,
generally speaking, stand near the base-line, opposite
the centre of the service court, a position
which commands either a fore or back-handed
stroke. Of course her position must naturally
depend upon the style of service given, and here
again, nothing but experience will impart the
intuitive consciousness of the exact spot on which
the ball is likely to drop. Through excess of
zeal and over anxiety to make a correct return,
the non-proficient player will nearly always commit
the error of rushing at her stroke and hitting
the ball while it is yet rising, instead of waiting
to catch it in the fall and lift it with a nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
vertical racket over the net. The ball should so
to speak be allowed to meet the player half way
<i>for an ordinary stroke</i>. Of course in the case of
a cut or a screw, which may bound backwards
instead of forwards, it is advisable to approach
the stroke more closely, but even in such a case
it is better to wait and see the angle of rising
before striking. Any undue hurry will cause the
ball to perform the feat known as "going through
the racket." <i>For the fore-handed stroke</i>, the racket
should be held in a firm grasp (as in Fig. C),
great care being taken that the position of the
fingers is correct from the first, the ball being
struck with a full racket. <i>For the back-handed
stroke</i>, the grip is changed (see Fig. D). This
change may at first appear a serious difficulty, but
after a little practice at fore and back-handed
strokes alternately, the change will become both
unconscious and mechanical.</p>

<p>The back-handed stroke is a weak point with
many players, for which reason extra attention
should be bestowed upon its cultivation. Any
attempt to run round the ball, or to take it "with
both hands," should from the first be severely
discouraged. Practising for the back-handed
stroke against a blank wall is advised by many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a><br /><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a><br /><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>competent authorities as a useful means of overcoming
preliminary awkwardness.</p>

<p><i>FORE-HANDED STROKE.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The position of the feet and body in lawn-tennis
is of the utmost importance. The player should
await her stroke standing facing the net with the
feet a little apart, and the weight of the body resting
on the toes. In the case of a fore-hand stroke
the left foot should be brought quickly across the
right, by way of turning the body sideways, while
the racket is swung back in readiness to receive
the stroke. When the ball is struck, the weight
of the body is shifted from the right foot to the
left. For a back-handed stroke the right foot is
brought across the left, and whilst striking the
weight is shifted from the left foot to the right.
<i>The Volley</i> has ever been a subject of controversy
in lawn-tennis annals. We all know what an instrument
of defence the stroke became off the
rackets of the Messrs. Renshaw; but at present
we are considering lawn-tennis from a woman's
point of view, which is a very different thing.
The ordinary variety of the volley is employed to
save change of position necessary in taking a ball
off the ground. This stroke resembles a "lob,"
and should be so placed as to obviate the chance
of punishment. <i>The volley from the net</i> is an over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>hand
stroke and may be played with either a bent
or extended arm, according to the force employed.
The latter variety, known as the "smash," is
given with an uncontrolled swing of the racket.
In the former stroke, where the force used is not
so great, an excellent effect may be obtained by
a quick turn of the wrist, either to right or left,
at the moment of striking the ball, causing it to
drop near the base of the side line. <i>The volley
from the service line</i> is played with a horizontal
racket, which may be held either below the bend
of the shoulder, or almost close to the ground,
when the player is obliged to stoop for the purpose
of "lifting" the ball over the net.</p>

<p><i>The half volley</i> is a stroke as difficult to attain
as to describe. Briefly it consists in blocking the
ball&mdash;roughly speaking&mdash;within the first half-foot
of its rise from the drop. The difficulty of
the stroke lies in estimating correctly the exact
spot on which the ball will drop, and in having
the racket ready <i>just behind</i> that spot. The stroke
is chiefly used in cases where retreat is impossible,
or at least likely to be attended with ill-success,
and when the reach is too short for a volley;
but it is a stroke which should be indulged in
with caution, as, unless in the case of exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a><br /><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a><br /><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>ally
good players, it is likely to prove a dismal
failure. That it can generally be dispensed with
by either a step forward, or a few steps back is
consoling to the medium performer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/illus-339.jpg" width="355" height="597" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Figure D.</i></p>

<p><i>BACK-HANDED STROKE.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p><i>The "Lob"</i> claims Mr. Haslow as its discoverer.
This gentleman, chiefly owing to the agency of
the stroke, succeeded in defeating the champion,
Mr. Spencer-Gore, who first practised volleying
tactics, in 1878. The "lob" is a useful invention
against net play, being merely a stroke lifted
high over the opponent's head, thus preventing a
volleying return. The counter tactics to this
stroke are technically known as the "smash," to
which reference has already been made, and the
"lob volley." The former of these two strokes
consists in getting the racket&mdash;either by reach or
springing into the air&mdash;above the ball and smashing
it with all the strength at the player's command,
to the confusion of the opponent, and the
alarm and consternation of the bye-standers. <i>The
"lob" volley</i> consists in catching the dropping
ball with a vertical drive similar to the ordinary
forward drive played off the ground.</p>

<p>Lady players will, as a general rule, find the
back game quite as effective, and a good deal
more graceful than forward or volleying tactics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
which owing to various circumstances, such as
the necessity for extra reach and freedom of movement&mdash;are
more suited to a man's play than a
woman's. The back game with the aid of judicious
"placing" will always prove hard to beat,
a few well-worn maxims for its successful issue
being: to hit as hard, and to keep the ball as
low as possible. Neither to court nor to avoid
volleying, but to take it as it comes. To
thoroughly master the art of "placing." Never
to relax good style by slovenly play, and finally
to follow in all cases the advice of a well-known
authority, "To start at once, to arrive in time,
and never to be in a hurry."</p>

LAWS OF THE GAME.</h2>


<h3>THE SINGLE-HANDED GAME.</h3>

<p>1.&mdash;For the single-handed game, the Court is 27 ft. in width and
78 ft. in length. It is divided across the middle by a net, the ends
of which are attached to the tops of two posts, which stand 3 ft.
outside the Court on each side. The height of the net is 3 ft. 6 in.
at the posts, and 3 ft. at the centre. At each end of the Court,
parallel with the net, and at a distance of 39 ft. from it, are drawn
the <i>Base-lines</i>, the extremities of which are connected by the <i>side-lines</i>.
Half-way between the side-lines, and parallel with them, is
drawn the <i>half-court-line</i>, dividing the space on each side of the net
into two equal parts, called the <i>right and left courts</i>. On each
side of the net, at a distance of 21 ft. from it, and parallel with it,
are drawn the <i>service-lines</i>.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The balls shall not be less than 2&frac12; in., nor more than 2-9/16
in. in diameter; and not less than 1-7/8 oz., nor more than 2 oz. in
weight.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;In matches where Umpires are appointed, their decision
shall be final; but where a Referee is appointed, an appeal shall lie
to him from the decision of an Umpire on a question of law.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The choice of sides and the right of serving during the first
games shall be decided by toss; provided that, if the winner of the
toss choose the right to serve, the other player shall have the choice
of sides, and <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>; and provided that the winner of the toss
may, if he prefer it, require the other player to make the first choice.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The players shall stand on opposite sides of the net; the
player who first delivers the ball shall be called the <i>Server</i>, the
other the <i>Striker-out</i>.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;At the end of the first game the Striker-out shall become
Server, and the Server shall become Striker-out; and so on alternately
in the subsequent games of the set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>7.&mdash;The Server shall stand with one foot beyond (<i>i.e.</i>, further
from the net than) the base line, and with the other foot upon the
base line, and shall deliver the service from the right and left
Courts alternately, beginning from the right.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;The ball served must drop within the service-line, half-court-line,
and side-line of the Court which is diagonally opposite
to that from which it was served, or upon any such line.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;It is a <i>fault</i> if the service be delivered from the wrong Court,
or if the Server do not stand as directed in Law 7, or if the ball
served drop in the net or beyond the service-line, or if it drop out
of Court or in the wrong Court; it is not a <i>fault</i> if the Server's foot,
which is beyond the base-line, do not touch the ground at the
moment at which the service is delivered.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;A fault may not be taken.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;After a fault, the Server shall serve again from the same
Court from which he served that fault, unless it was a fault because
served from the wrong Court.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;A fault may not be claimed after the next service has been
delivered.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;The service may not be <i>volleyed</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, taken before it touches
the ground.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;The Server shall not serve until the Striker-out is ready.
If the latter attempt to return the service, he shall be deemed to be
ready.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;A ball is <i>in-play</i> from the moment at which it is delivered
in service (unless a fault) until it has been volleyed by the Striker-out
in his first stroke, or has dropped in the net or out of Court, or
has touched either of the players or anything that he wears or
carries, except his racket in the act of striking, or has been struck
by either of the players with his racket more than once consecutively,
or has been volleyed before it has passed over the net, or has
failed to pass over the net before its first bound (except as provided
in Law 17), or has touched the ground twice consecutively on either
side of the net, though the second time may be out of Court.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;It is a <i>let</i> if the ball served touch the net, provided the
service be otherwise good; or if a service or fault be delivered when
the Striker-out is not ready; or if either player be prevented by an
accident beyond his control from serving or returning the ball in
play. In case of a let, the service or stroke counts for nothing, and
the server shall serve again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>17.&mdash;It is a good return although the ball touch the net, or, having
passed outside either post, drop on or within any of the lines
which bound the Court into which it is returned.</p>

<p>18.&mdash;The Server wins a stroke if the Striker-out volley the service,
or fail to return the service or the ball in-play (except in the
case of a let), or return the service or ball in play so that it drop
outside any of the lines which bound his opponent's Court, or otherwise
lose a stroke, as provided by Law 20.</p>

<p>19.&mdash;The Striker-out wins a stroke if the Server serve two consecutive
faults, or fail to return the ball in-play (except in the case
of a let), or return the ball in-play so that it drop outside any of the
lines which bound his opponent's Court, or otherwise lose a stroke,
as provided by Law 20.</p>

<p>20.&mdash;Either player loses a stroke if the ball in-play touch him or
anything that he wears or carries, except his racket in the act of
striking; or it he touch or strike the ball in-play with his racket
more than once consecutively; or if he touch the net or any of its
supports while the ball is in-play; or if he volley the ball before it
has passed the net.</p>

<p>21.&mdash;On either player winning his first stroke, the score is called

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Players may agree not to play advantage-sets, but to decide
the set by one game after arriving at the score of games-all.</p>

<p>23.&mdash;The players shall change sides at the end of every set, but
the Umpire, on appeal from either party, before the toss for choice,
shall direct the players to change sides at the end of the <i>first, third,
and every subsequent alternate game of each set</i>, provided that in such
event the players shall not change sides at the end of a set if the
number of games in such set be even; but if the appeal be made
after a match has been begun, the Umpire shall only direct the
players to change sides at the end of the <i>first, third, and every subsequent
alternate game of the odd and concluding set</i>.</p>

<p>24.&mdash;When a series of sets is played, the player who was Server
in the last game of one set, shall be Striker-out in the first game of
the next.</p>

<h3>THE THREE-HANDED AND FOUR-HANDED GAME.</h3>

<p>27.&mdash;The above laws shall apply to the three-handed and four-handed
games, except as below.</p>

<p>28.&mdash;For the three-handed and four-handed games, the Court is
36 ft. in width. Within the side-lines, at a distance of 4&frac12; ft. from
them, and parallel with them, are drawn the service-side-lines. In
other respects the Court is similar to that which is described in
Law 1.</p>

<p>29.&mdash;In the three-handed game, the single player shall serve in
every alternate game.</p>

<p>30.&mdash;In the four-handed game, the pair who have the right to
serve in the first game may decide which partner shall do so, and
the opposing pair may decide similarly for the second game. The
partner of the player who served in the first game shall serve in the
third; and the partner of the player who served in the second game
shall serve in the fourth, and so on in the same order in all the subsequent
games of a set.</p>

<p>31.&mdash;The players shall take the service alternately throughout
each game; no player shall receive or return a service delivered to
his partner; and the order of service and of striking out, once
arranged, shall not be altered, nor shall the Striker-out change
Courts to receive the service before the end of the set.</p>

<p>32.&mdash;The ball served must drop within the service-line, half-court-line,
and service-side-line of the Court, which is diagonally
opposite to that from which it was served, or upon any such line.</p>

<p>33.&mdash;It is a <i>fault</i> if the ball do not drop as provided in Law 32,
or if it touch the Server's partner, or anything that he wears or
carries.</p>

<p>34.&mdash;If a player serve out of his turn, the Umpire, as soon as the
mistake is discovered by himself or by one of the players, shall direct
the player to serve who ought to have served; but all strokes
scored, and any fault served before such discovery, shall be reckoned.
If a game shall have been completed before such discovery, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
service in the next alternate game shall be delivered by the partner
of the player who served out of his turn; and so on in regular
rotation.</p>


<h3>KNOTTY POINTS.<br />

ADDENDA TO THE LAWS OF THE GAME.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Revised and approved by the Council of the Lawn-Tennis Association.</i>)</p>

<p>1.&mdash;In no case may the Striker-out volley the service, not even
if the ball is clearly outside the service court.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;A player who is struck by, or strikes a ball <i>in play</i> (unless he
thereby makes a good return) loses the stroke, no matter whether he
is standing within the limits of the court or outside them. (For
definition of "in play" see Law 15.)</p>

<p>3.&mdash;If the service is delivered before the Striker-out is ready, and
he tries to return it, but fails, he loses the stroke.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;If the Striker-out cries "not ready" after the service has
been delivered, but before the ball touches the ground, he may not
claim a fault because the ball ultimately drops outside the service
Court.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;If the Server, in attempting to serve, misses the ball altogether,
it does not count as a fault, but it the ball is touched, no
matter how slightly, by the racket, a service is thereby delivered
and the rules governing the service at once apply.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;If a ball, served or returned, drops into the proper Court and
screws or is blown back over the net, the player whose turn it is to
strike may reach over the net and play the ball, provided that neither
he nor any part of his clothes or racket touch the net. If he
fails to play the ball, the stroke of course scores to his opponent,
notwithstanding that the ball has gone back over the net.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;If a player throws his racket at the ball and so returns the
ball into the proper Court, he loses the stroke.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;If a player catches the balls on his racket, walks with it to
the net, and, reaching over, drops it into Court, he loses the stroke,
as such a proceeding cannot be defined as an "act of striking" (<i>vide</i>
law 15).</p>

<p>9.&mdash;If a player's racket passes over the net after he has returned
the ball, he does not lose, providing the ball has passed
over the net before being played, and has been properly returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>10.&mdash;If a player or his racket touches the posts or supports of the
net or posts while the ball is in-play, he loses the stroke. (For definition
of "in-play" see law 15.)</p>

<p>II.&mdash;If a player's racket slips out of his hand and touches the net
while the ball is in-play, he loses the stroke.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;If a player to avoid touching the net, jumps over it while
the ball is in play, he loses the stroke.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;If a ball is returned outside the posts, either above or below
the level of the top of the net, and drops into Court, it is a good
return.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;If a player succeeds in returning a ball served or in-play
which strikes a ball lying in the Court, it is a good return.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;If a spectator impedes, or in any way interferes with, a
player, a "let" may be allowed under Law 16.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;A "let" does not annul a previous fault.</p>

<p>17.&mdash;The service always commences from the right-hand Court,
even though odds are given or owed, and the service always continues
alternately from the right and left Courts.</p>

<p>18.&mdash;If an Umpire erroneously calls "fault" and at once corrects
himself and cries "play," and the striker-out tails to return the ball,
a "let" must be allowed.</p>

<p>19.&mdash;If the ball in play (other than a service) strikes any part of
the net or its supports, or the centre stay, no matter how low down
(provided it does not touch the ground), and eventually goes over
into the proper Court, it is a good return.</p>

<p>20.&mdash;If in a double game the Server's service strikes <i>either</i> of his
opponents, he wins the stroke.</p>

<p>21.&mdash;If a match is postponed on account of rain or darkness
coming on, or for any similar reason, and is continued on the subsequent
day, the match shall be resumed from the point where it
was discontinued on the previous day. An entirely new commencement
may only be made with the consent of the Referee.</p>

<p>22.&mdash;If two players in a handicap play at the wrong odds, the
match stands, unless they have been wrongly instructed by the
referee, or any person or persons acting under his instructions, in
which case the loser may claim to have the match replayed, unless
the mistake in the odds has been in his favour. Such claim must
be made within a reasonable time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>23.&mdash;A similar decision must be given if two players neglect to
play advantage sets when one of the conditions of the event in
which they are competing is that advantage sets should be played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>


<h3>HANDICAPS. Table No. 1. (Received Odds).</h3>

<p>When two players, both in receipt of odds, meet, the player receiving the smaller odds is put back to scratch. The following Table shows the point at which the
other should then start. The number at the left of the horizontal columns denotes the player who goes back to scratch, those at the head of the vertical columns the
player who still receives odds; and the numbers within the columns show the odds to be received by the player whose number stands at the head of the column:</p>

<h3>REGULATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT
OF LAWN-TENNIS PRIZE MEETINGS.</h3>

<p>1.&mdash;At Prize Meetings promoted by associations or clubs affiliated
to the Lawn-Tennis Association, the laws of lawn-tennis for the
time being sanctioned by the Lawn-Tennis Association, and the
regulations hereinafter contained, shall be observed.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;All details connected with any Prize Meeting shall be settled
by the Committee of the club holding the meeting, or by a Committee
specially appointed for the purpose, of whom two, or such
larger number as the Committee may determine, shall form a
quorum.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;A circular shall be issued by the Committee specifying the
conditions of the competition (see Recommendation 5).</p>

<p>4.&mdash;No cheques, orders for money, or cash payments in any form
shall be given as prizes, and the amount actually paid for each prize
shall in no case be below the advertised value of the same.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The Committee shall elect a Referee, with power to appoint
a substitute to be approved by them.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;The Referee, or such other member or members of the Committee
as may be selected for the purpose, shall have power to
appoint Umpires, and the Referee shall decide any point of law
which an Umpire may profess himself unable to decide, or which
may be referred to him on appeal from the decision of an Umpire.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;The Referee shall, during the Meeting, be <i>ex-officio</i> a member
of the Committee.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;The Courts shall be allotted to the Competitors, and the
Competitors shall be called upon to play, by a member or members
of the Committee, to be selected for the purpose, and in case of
disagreement the Committee shall decide.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;The Committee shall help to keep order on the ground, and
shall consult and decide upon any question arising out of the competition,
if summoned for that purpose by the Referee or by any
two of their number; and they shall have power, when so convened,
the misconduct of a Competitor having been reported to them by a
member of the Committee or an Umpire, to disqualify the offender,
and further to order him off the ground, should his misconduct
appear to them to justify such action, but before such action shall
be taken, an opportunity of offering an explanation shall be afforded
to the Competitor whose misconduct has been reported to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>10.&mdash;It is the duty of an Umpire&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>a.</i> To ascertain that the net is at the right height before the
commencement of play, and to measure and adjust the
net during play, if asked to do so, or if, in his opinion,
its height has altered;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> To call the faults (subject to Regulation 11);</p>

<p><i>c.</i> To call the strokes when won, or when he is asked to call
them, and to record them on the Umpire's second
sheet;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><i>d.</i> To call the games and the sets at the end of each, or when
asked to call them, and to record them on the Umpire's
scoring sheet;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">NOTE.</span>&mdash;At the end of each game the games should be called with
the name of the player who is in advance, thus: "2 games to 1,
B. wins," or "B. leads." If the games are level the score should
be called thus, "3 games all," or as the case may be. At the end
of each set the sets should be called in like manner.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>e.</i> To direct the competitors to change sides, in accordance
with Law 23;</p>

<p><i>f.</i> When appealed to, during a rest, whether a doubtful ball
is "in-play" or not, to call "Play it out," and at the
conclusion of the rest, to give his decision (subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Regulation 11) or direct the Competitors to play the
stroke again;</p>

<p><i>g.</i> To decide all doubtful or disputed strokes, and all points
of law (subject to Regulations 11 and 12);</p>

<p><i>h.</i> In handicap matches to call the odds at the commencement
of each set;</p>

<p><i>i.</i> To sign the Umpire's scoring sheets, and to deliver them
at the conclusion of the match to such person as the
Committee may authorize to receive them;</p></div>

<p>Provided, that no omission of any of the foregoing duties on the
part of an Umpire shall of itself invalidate a game or match.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;It is the duty of a Line-Umpire to call faults and to decide
strokes relating to the line for which he is appointed Umpire, and
to such line only.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;The decision of an Umpire shall be final upon every question
of fact, and no Competitor may appeal from it; but if an
Umpire be in doubt as to a point of law, or if a Competitor appeal
against his decision on such a point, the Umpire shall submit to it
the Referee, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>13.&mdash;The Referee shall not bet on a match, nor shall an Umpire
on a match in which he is acting, and if an objection for this or
any other reason be made to a Referee or Umpire, either before or
during the match, by a member of the Committee or a Competitor,
the match, if begun, shall, if necessary, be at once stopped by the
Referee or two members of the Committee, who shall take the
opinion of the Committee on the objection, and the Committee
shall have power to remove or suspend the Referee or Umpire so
objected to; provided that the decision of the majority of the Committee
present shall be final, and that the Referee or Umpire so
objected to (if a member of the Committee) shall not be at liberty
to vote on the question.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;No competitor may transfer his entry to another player.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;Competitors shall have a right, by themselves or their deputies,
to be present at the draw.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;The draw shall be conducted in the following manner:&mdash;Each
Competitor's name shall be written on a separate card or
paper, and these shall be placed in bowl or hat, drawn out one by
by one at random, and copied on a list in the order in which they
have been drawn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>17.&mdash;When the number of Competitors is 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or
any higher power of 2, they shall meet in pairs, in accordance with
the system shown by the following diagram:</p>

<p>When two players in different classes below scratch meet, the
superior player shall start from scratch, and the odds received by
the inferior player are as shown by the annexed table, No. 1. To
use the table, find in the diagonal line of figures the number representing
the class of the superior player, then travel along the corresponding
horizontal column until the vertical column is reached,
which bears at the top the number of the class of the inferior player.
The odds specified at the intersection of the two columns are the
odds required.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i>&mdash;If Class 3 has to meet Class 9, start from the figure 3
in the diagonal line of figures, and look horizontally until the vertical
column is reached headed by the figure 6. The odds given
at the point of intersection of the two columns (viz., 15 and 1-sixth
of 15) are the odds required.</p>

<p>When the two players in different classes above scratch meet, the
inferior player shall start from scratch, and the odds owed by the
superior player are as shown by the annexed table, No. II.</p>

<p>This table is to be used in the same way as the former, the class
of the superior player being looked for in the horizontal line of
figures at the top, and the class of the inferior player in the diagonal
line of figures.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i>&mdash;If Class 12 (owe 30) meet Class 7 (owe 15 and one-sixth
